Haddock was fried perfectly and it was super moist inside. I have to complain a bit on the house made tartar sauce though - there was no bite to it at all. I expect some briney caper\\/gherkin flavour to hit me right off the bat but it never came. Husband had the buffalo wings and they were perfectly standard.\n","\n","No complaints about Dog \u0026 Bear if you're wanting to catch a game and have some pub grub but it's nothing spectacular.\n","before My favourite burrito in the city. I always get the small bean and cheese on whole wheat and it is consistently delicious. Their refried beans are creamy and have a smoky flavour to them. The hot sauce has a great kick alongside the fresh (not pickled - yuck) jalapenos. And I also love the burrito sauce - I usually ask to skip the sour cream and just double up on the sauce.\n","The kicker is how long they flat-top grill the burrito at the end. Other places will do this for mere seconds which is good for the impatient, but it is so worth waiting for that crispy exterior which melts into a soft creamy tortilla underneath. \n","\n","Yum yum.\n","\n","PS: during workday lunch hours it's best to call ahead\n","before We live across the street from Mabel's and are frequent shoppers there. It is a fantastic neighborhood spot and a great place to drop in on a Saturday or Sunday morning when you're walking the dog.\n","\n","Our favourites include: croissants, almond croissants, sourdough bread, any of the cookies, the carrot cake, the empanadas (Veg or Meat), and the roast beef arugala \u0026 horseradish sandwich on a pretzel bun. Every item is made with care and the best ingredients. Also they brew a mean cup of coffee.\n","\n","They are not getting 5\\/5 stars from me because the prices are a touch high (although I respect the business and the quality of ingredients they are paying for), and MOSTly because my husband adores the almond croissants - The Grid (RIP) even did a write up on them - and they never have them anymore. Inventory management issue I suppose.\n","\n","Anyways if you haven't been, GO. Awesome spot to grab a dessert if you're having a dinner party too - pies, cakes, squares etc. are perfection.\n","before Bought my wedding dress here and they were very helpful while not too pushy. They have a great selection of Watters and Wtoo if you like those lines.\n","\n","Appointments for fittings were set up easily by email and the seamstress\\/tailor that they use was very professional. I recommend!\n","before Not sure what's going on at this location lately. It's obviously under new management because none of the regular suspects are working anymore. \n","\n","The debit\\/credit machine is often not working now, and when it is the receipt shows up as \"My Sandwich\". I am one to look at my receipt so I can assure you it used to say \"Sandwich Box\". \n","\n","Also the bread selection has changed, my go-to whole grain panini is now thicker and doesn't toast up as nicely. They are much skimpier with the sandwich toppings and the side salad is always over dressed. \n","\n","Pretty upset about this new development. May have to resort to Quiznos in the future, or, god forbid, make my own lunch!\n","before I had very high hopes and it passed the test. Lil' Cheeseburger is more than enough food for most people, it's really not lil' at all. Beef is very fresh and tasty. The bun is soft and stands out compared to most. I'm also a sucker for American cheese on a burg. Melty goodness.\n","\n","Both types of fries were a bit disappointing but I would definitely choose regular over cajun in future. \n","\n","A welcome US chain doing burgers properly.\n","before This is my husband and my go to brunch spot and not just because we live close by! I LOVE the smoked salmon - either on a bagel or the benny, it is hot smoked and flaked not like a lox or gravlax style. The regular Drake benny is equally delicious as is the regular breakfast. I had a bite of fried chicken and waffles for the first time last week, chicken is boneless which I enjoyed. It's not really my thing but each element was executed well (crispy chicken, fluffy waffle, tart cherries).\n","\n","The hot sauce is hot but also has some flavour, I'd almost call it apricot-y. Use it sparingly but on any egg or potato dish.\n","\n","Don't miss the Caesar if you're in the mood, plenty of horseradish for a nice kick. If you don't feel like alcohol, the latte is so creamy and delicious, always a nice treat. \n","\n","Reasonably priced for the quality. Patio is a great scene in the summer, nice people watching.\n","before Roti's are delicious I too love the butter chicken and am looking forward to trying a vegetarian roti next time.\n","\n","They are very one-note but I suppose that's to be expected. I only mention it because it is a very large portion and by the end I find myself feeling very full and a bit tired of having one taste sensation. I'll accept your rage towards that comment if you must.\n","\n","Definitely spicy as others have mentioned, I go medium and it's what others may consider hot hot. \n","\n","Very tasty, certainly over priced, but sometimes when the time comes I gotta have some Gandhi.\n","before I should probably be more generous with the stars here because I eat there often but there are just too many better burrito joints in the city.\n","\n","This location is down the street from me so I go often due to my burrito addiction. I basically always get the lil (their smallest size) bean and cheese on whole wheat. Same order I get at Burrito Bandidos but this place just gets something wrong along the way.\n","\n","Beans are tasty and smokey in flavour, they offer chow mein along with the rice but I usually skip it. Bit too much starch for my liking. Then they have the usual toppings that I indulge in - lettuce, pico de gallo, jalapeno, cilantro, peppers, salsa, sour cream, burrito sauce (it's very tasty here), but they also have coleslaw which I think is gross and the vinegar dressing takes over and runs throughout the burrito. They also will crunch up some chips in there which is kind of a nice touch. Watch out for the hot sauce, I ask for a little bit which can vary depending on the person making it but it is extremely spicy. My husband likes the burn so he goes for it.\n","\n","They grill the burritos which I also appreciate but again it never comes out like Bandidos. \n","\n","Try the Blair's Death Rain chips if you want to ruin your night and your taste buds! \n","\n","In conclusion, it gives me my fix when I need one and that's about it.\n","before Been living down the street from here for over a year now and finally checked it out with the husband on Sunday. \n","\n","Overall it was a very good experience, we made a reservation for 7pm but it was probably unnecessary, some good traffic coming in off the street but it wasn't busy. Perhaps around 8 or 9 this would be a different story. \n","\n","We started with drinks, I ordered a Steamwhistle but they were unfortunately out, fine I'll have a Mill St. My husband had Tommy's Margarita. The drink list is quite extensive I'm just not big on fancy cocktails, I'm all about the food! His margarita was deliciously tart and had a definite bite of tequila which was nice - but unfortunately no salt rim, so we probably wouldn't get it again. \n","\n","For food I ordered a deviled egg - they were out of these too, now I was officially disappointed. Husband had  couple of oysters to start and I went right for my main, the famous fried chicken thigh sandwich. It was very very good. I am not a huge avocado fan but it was very citrusy and added a really nice balance to the delectable fried chicken. The breading was crisp and the bun was perfectly soft. Fries on the side were good too mostly due to the homemade ketchup - a tangy\\/spiced version of the classic.\n","\n","Husband had the Yorkshire BBQ Pork. This was a surprising dish, really well composed and perfectly executed. The pork was essentially a barbecued loin with a nice crust on the outside and slathered in kansas city bbq sauce. It was beautifully cooked and paired so well with the sweetish sauce and meaty, rich collared greens. I could have eaten a loaf of the cornbread that had real kernels of corn inside for a nice textural contrast. \n","\n","We passed on dessert this time but we will be back. Hopefully they'll have a deviled egg for me!\n","before Bit of an odd process to ordering but worth it for the momos. \n","\n","Ordered 10 beef steamed, 10 beef fried, and 10 veg steamed (suggested by the owner). We also ordered one paratha. Wanted the potato balls but they were out. \n","\n","Everything was delicious. We liked the steamed more than fried. I particularly enjoyed the flavour of the veg. Watch out for the hot sauce. Totally delicious but as a fan of spice even I was reaching for water. Paratha was a miss - not much filling and seemed quite doughy. \n","\n","Everything came to $24 and worth every penny.\n","before So it's nothing spectacular but when I'm in the burbs I will never pass up an invite for Montfort's lunch or dinner.\n","\n","I usually get the Montfort Chicken pita, basically shawarma with some pineapple in the mix shoved into a warm pita with lettuce and tomato. They give you complimentary sauces, one garlic and one onion chutney, both equally delicious and should definitely be poured generously into your sandwich. \n","\n","I've had salads before, as well as the falafel and the plain shawarma pitas and it's all very good. They are nice people at this location also, been there a long time.\n","before Was here for lunch in January and was quite impressed. I'd call this the more casual sister of Mye downtown Oakville. \n","\n","I had the chicken teriyaki lunch. What a far cry from the typical sushi joint teriyaki bento box. This was a real chicken breast, skin on, that had been cooked to perfection and marinated\\/glazed with teriyaki sauce. It was so moist, I devoured it with a side of rice. I did miss the cabbage that you often get in combination. \n","\n","Also shared a spicy tuna roll with my husband and it was excellent however next time I'd go with nigiri. They seem to have high quality fish here so a nice piece of fish would probably be heavenly.\n","\n","Quality green tea as my beverage made for a very enjoyable lunch!\n","before This place is busy every Mon-Fri during lunch time and there's a good reason why! The food is very fresh and tastes very authentic. Compared to any of the (many) other take-out burrito joints in the area (Burrito Boyz, Burrito Bandidos, Mucho Burrito etc.) this place has real Mexican ingredients and recipes being executed all day long - you can see the women making the meats, salas and guacamole in the store. \n","\n","I give them less stars because the actual burritos are sub par. They over load them and then bake them as opposed to putting them on a flat-top or a press. I find this compromises the abilities of the tortilla and more often than not it rips. \n","\n","The naked burrito, or burrito bowl however is VERY good. I prefer the chicken tinga which is shredded chicken in a chipotle\\/adobo type sauce. It comes on top of rice and your choice of beans (black or refried pinto), and with cheese, salsas, guacamole, sour cream, burrito sauce, and cilantro. They also serve a generous handful of tortilla chips on the side which is nice for dipping. \n","\n","At around $10+tax for any item it's not very cheap but you will get a hefty portion.\n","before 3 stars, or \"A-Ok\" perfectly describes CJ Lunch Box.\n","\n","I work in the area and frequent this spot for lunch (as does everyone else in the area I think). The value is hard to beat, for $6 you can get 8 pieces of maki (my preference is red tuna or the tempura shrimp) and a tray of edamame. Miso soup is far from great but it's free so who can complain?\n","\n","I have had the noodles and spicy chicken before and they are pretty delicious, mind you I felt like garbage a few hours later. The fried dumplings fall into the same category.\n","\n","The owner CJ is always so friendly and upbeat and they really do their best to get you in and out quickly.\n","before Had lunch at Rock Lobster today for a colleague's birthday.\n","\n","We had a group of 6 so we called yesterday to make a reservation but unfortunately they don't take reservations - all too common these days. Luckily we walked in at noon and had no problem getting a table. \n","\n","Service was attentive and helpful. 3 of my colleagues had the fish and chips (made with haddock) and they looked very good, served on a slate platter and accompanied by ketchup, tartar sauce (which I was told was very good) and a charred lemon half which I also thought was a nice touch. 2 other colleagues had the lobster poutine which was a smaller portion than I had expected from pictures and judging by the price. It smelled very good however and they enjoyed it. \n","\n","I had the lobster roll, which comes with a side of house cut chips, and I added a side of potato salad cause I'm a sucker for it. As with the lobster poutine I thought the meat could have been a bit chunkier. It wasn't a skimpy portion but it looks like it is when the meat is shredded as it was. I did appreciate the restraint on the mayo but I missed a bit of seasoning and perhaps some mild additions to the roll (some celery or something?). The chips and potato salad were excellent, the potato salad had nice crunch from pickle and celery in it and a tasty dill creamy dressing. \n","\n","Overall I would go back to try some other menu items, curious about the jerk shrimp roll and that fish and chips looked great. Also want to try that over priced over garnished caesar sometime.\n","before Pretty average breakfast\\/brunch spot in Parkdale with a gorgeous interior! \n","\n","We live close by and I had been meaning to check this spot out for awhile. Seems like a bit of a hidden gem, we got a booth right away on a Saturday around noon for brunch. The building is beautiful inside, big windows, and a high tin ceiling. \n","\n","Husband had the eggs benedict and enjoyed it, said it was pretty standard (he is very partial to the benny at the Drake). I had the roasted veggie and goat cheese omlette. I thought it was very good, eggs were nicely cooked and they didn't skimp on the chevre. Both meals came with home fries and mine also had toast (choice of rye, multigrain, brown or white). \n","\n","I thought the prices were more than fair and the service was friendly. I'd go back but it's nothing very special, especially in an area swarming with brunch spots.\n","before Was here for dinner with a girlfriend this week. I had been before for drinks but had not eaten. I'm glad we went!\n","\n","Service was excellent, our waiter was very informed regarding the menu - my friend is gluten-free and he was accommodating, suggesting some substitutions on various dishes that can be made by the kitchen. We each had a glass of wine, 9oz and an entree. \n","\n","I was torn between the chicken pot pie and the piri piri chicken and I'm so glad I went with the latter! I am always very impressed when restaurants are able to cook chicken breasts so juicy while ensuring the skin is crisp. The piri piri sauce had just enough heat and the wheatberry salad on the side was excellent - it was filled with roasted carrot and eggplant (I think) and as a non-eggplant fan that was one of my favourite parts of the dish! \n","\n","My friend had the braised lamb dish and the aroma was enough to make me want it next time I go to Bannock. It was an Indian inspired dish, served usually with garlic roti but for her GF substitution she had taro root chips - yum! \n","\n","Prices were very reasonable and it wasn't the usually small portions you see at O\u0026B restaurants. I'll be back!\n","before Yet another superb lunch spot in this area of the city. I am lucky to work at Adelaide and Spadina, we are spoiled for options!\n","\n","Colleagues took me here for my birthday lunch last week, it was my second time at Jules and both have been very enjoyable. \n","\n","The staff are very friendly and without a reservation, seated us right away. If you're a bigger group, aim to go around 11:30 because it did pick up. I had the spinach and goat cheese quiche with salad, it is such a satisfying lunch. The pastry on the quiche is dynamite and there was an abundance of spinach and cheese in the filling. \n","\n","Worth mentioning they will allow 1\\/2 salad and 1\\/2 fries on the side at Jules! One of my colleagues had the burger medium-rare and it looked delicious, they clearly use a high quality beef. We all enjoyed our meals thoroughly.\n","\n","My husband raves about the steak frites here, it is a bit much for me to order at lunch but it seems very popular so it must be good! \n","\n","Nice bistro lunch, slightly fancy compared to the other spots around here.\n","before We have ordered from Trimurti for 5 years. I still love their food but I won't be ordering from them again. \n","\n","They didn't deliver my rice that I paid for this evening. When I called to let them know the manager refused to send someone with the rice and would only say he would comp rice on my next order. Unacceptable.\n","before This is a pretty special place, however even so the lines are WAY too long.\n","\n","We waited late last summer for a good 20min. I had the coconut lemon curd cone. It was delicious and I would say reasonably priced at $6 or so, but the novelty has now worn off, I wouldn't wait again for what it is. \n","\n","Once the hype dies down, if ever, I would like to try one of their fancy affogatos.\n","before YUMMY! I was here in February for a friend's birthday. She had organized a fixed sharing menu for the group - I highly recommend as the staff was very accommodating and attentive.\n","\n","We had dips and super soft pita, spanakopita, octopus, tomato salad, lamb chops with tabouli and tzatziki, spicy potatoes and assorted ice cream and cookies for dessert.\n","\n","I can't find a fault with the meal. The lamb chops were the star, I loved the smokey meat paired with creamy tzatziki and some acid from the tabouli. I could have eaten the platter. Spanakopita was also an impressive version, very flaky pastry and a savoury salty filling. \n","\n","The atmosphere was also really fun and lively, I'm going to go back this summer and pretend I'm in Greece.\n","before Yum! I was at Hibachi in Oakville with my family a month or so ago and we all loved the food.\n","\n","This is a pretty traditional teppanyaki set up with your choice of appetizers and protein to go with the veggies and your choice of white or fried rice. I had the shrimp and chicken combo and it was really delicious. I would argue that the vegetables were served a bit too early so I didn't have much left by the time my protein joined the party but that didn't stop me from polishing off my food. The two sauces (one creamy, meant for seafood; one soy based, meant for the chicken\\/steak) were delicious and kind of made the meal for me. Next time I will go with steak and shrimp as my dad and husband's beef looked very well cooked, nice medium rare. \n","\n","I would like to go back asap!\n","before Everything from the decor to the staff and of course the food is on point at Wilbur. \n","\n","Colleague and I went in for lunch last week, we arrived at noon and seemed to just miss the rush (by 12:30 there was a lineup to order). We were greeted at the door by a really nice guy who asked if we had been to the restaurant before, we said no, and he walked us through the menu and ordering system. You order at the front counter, get a number and sit anywhere. \n","\n","Our food was brought to us within 5min! We split the guacamole and queso and each had 2 tacos as well. The guacamole was so fresh, to my taste it could have been a bit spicier but the queso offset that as it had some nice heat to it. I thoroughly enjoyed both. It's worth noting you do get a nice handful of chips with the tacos so we ended up with quite a lot of chips - very filling! For my tacos I had the bulgogi beef (with sriracha cream, pear, cabbage, and sesame seeds), and the pork (with pickled red onion, jalapeno-cilantro crema, and cotija cheese). \n","\n","The meats were so delicious and well cooked and the toppings really complimented the whole thing. Neither had any real heat to them but that is preferable in a place where the salsa and hot sauce selections are endless. I gave the ghost pepper salsa a try - do not fear it is tolerable but definitely hot, and the salsa verde was another fave. \n","\n","Throughout our visit we were checked on twice by a very helpful employee. I think this place will be around for awhile, and I'll be back very soon! Excited to try those brisket taquitos!\n","before I'm not always a fan of a limited menu, I don't want a tonne of options but Mr. Flamingo was a bit reserved. \n","\n","Having said that, I shared a couple of yummy dishes with my friend. Star for me was the gnocchi. It was like high end mac and cheese, I was scraping the plate with my fork. We also had a trout dish that was okay but certainly not disappointing. \n","\n","Nice wine selection, reasonable prices and a cozy atmosphere. Probably a good date spot!\n","before Awesome show! So many finds for yourself or for gifts!\n","\n","Not to mention the food! You can make a meal out of sampling here, and everything is gourmet. I bought some incredibly delicious pear flavoured balsamic vinegar that will be fantastic in salad dressings. \n","\n","The show is huge so I would suggest taking a look through the map and vendor lists before you head off in a certain direction. I was there on a weekday evening and it was comfortably busy, not overly crowded. \n","\n","Definitely recommend going - I will be back next year!\n","before Was here last Sunday for brunch and have to say it the experience was rather disappointing. \n","\n","When we arrived we waited a few minutes at the door for the hostess who didn't seem busy enough to ignore us. We were then seated at a table right in front of the door, high traffic area, and there were clearly other seats in the back. When we asked to move she said once the table beside us was vacated we could move there. Rather rude to both parties.\n","\n","Again on poor service, took awhile to take drink orders, took 10 minutes to receive said drinks. The caesar is small for the money, the Drake serves a better tasting caesar, in a taller glass, for less money. \n","\n","I did really enjoy the huevos rancheros, the black beans and feta are sandwiched between 2 toasted tortillas and the eggs and salsa on top were delicious. My husband did not enjoy his eggs benny as much. He was also disappointed that they used to offer chorizo as a meat on the benny but today it was only bacon. \n","\n","Finally when it came time to pay I showed my Live Green card which the site clearly indicates gets 10% off dine in. The staff not only didn't recognize it but seemed put off by my request. The manager granted the discount and took a picture for future reference. \n","\n","The Gladstone is a beautiful spot but there are much better brunch spots in the area.\n","before This review is for the dog park at Clarence Square.\n","\n","Mon-Fri gets a bit rowdy at 5pm with everyone walking their dogs post-work. However it is a really big space with water fountains and some benches with nice shade for us humans. I prefer the parks with wood chips over pebbles but my pup loves it here so what can I do.\n","before I still love Fresh, I just have to gripe about them switching their cornbread recipe to be gluten-free. The new stuff is awful and completely bland. Why can't they have both and let the customer choose? \n","\n","My soup salad cornbread meal will never be the same.\n","before Another lunch spot near the office, it does the trick when I have a shawarma craving but I've had much better. \n","\n","Positives are that I see them charring the chicken early in the morning on my way in so I know they're not serving leftover meat from the day before. It is real meat and deliciously marinated. I also enjoy their garlic and hot sauces. The price point is more than fair as well at around $6 for a nice sized sandwich. \n","\n","Negatives are that the place doesn't seem the cleanest, I've heard some stories of rodents and I know they've had conditional passes before but so long as I see the green pass when I go in, it doesn't bother me too much. Also they don't press the sandwich enough at the end, they have a line everyday so I imagine they're trying to pump out as many meals as possible. As a result the sandwich is often cold by the time I eat it.\n","\n","3* A-okay, does the trick.\n","before Went on my birthday earlier this month, showed my ID and they give you a DOZEN free bagels. Your choice of flavours (with the exception of the twister and flat bagels). They even gave me a freezer bag so I could make sure they don't spoil at home. I'm still working on them and have enjoyed some delicious smoked salmon sandwiches this month :)\n","before My first ever macaron. I shared a 1\\/2 dozen with a friend, total of around $14.80\n","\n","They were delicious! I had pistachio, earl grey, and marshmallow passionfruit. The pistachio was definitely my favourite, but it's really about the texture with these little presents. The slightly crisp exterior gives way to a chewy centre and creamy filling. They are definitely a treat (or a nice gift) at the price, but worth it for a rare indulgence.\n","\n","Only lost a star for lack of seating. There is a room in the basement where you can sit to enjoy but it's a bit strange, sort of a bar\\/lounge setting and quite dark. Nice to have the option but you're better off taking a walk with your dessert.\n","before It's a chain, it's not always 100% but it is damn good Tex Mex. My fiance and I frequent this location and split our 1lb steak fajitas and 2 texas size margaritas. I am not a huge meat eater and would generally order chicken when I have the option - but the steak here is really well cooked and certainly tastier than the chicken (the chicken is however moist as sometimes we have done 1\\/2 and 1\\/2).\n","\n","Watch out for the free chips and salsa at the beginning - they too are killer and dangerous when you have a pound of meat and veggies coming your way. Oh make sure you pick up on your waiter\\/waitress' super-cheasy nicknames, they're always good for a laugh.\n","\n","Margaritas are tart, salty, sour, sweet, and tequila-filled. We love them and can't hit up Lonestar without having one. Might want to follow it up with a beer to compliment your meal though.\n","\n","Saving the best for last - the tortillas. This is the reason Lonestar gets an actual review from me given we are taking about chain-produced fajitas. The tortillas are made in a machine in-house that you can watch go to work. They come out hot and they're almost a bit thicker than the ones you can buy at the grocery store. I toy with buying some to bring home for some kind of sandwich or dessert filling one day.\n","\n","One final note - if you like hot sauce, theirs is spectacular. We have purchased a bottle to bring home on more than one occasion.\n","before Went here for a special last dinner with my girlfriends before I got married this summer. It was probably the most memorable dining experience I've had in a long time!\n","\n","The plates are more sharing plates, although I think you could definitely share a small plate and get one to yourself. We just ordered a bunch of things (with help from our excellent server) and shared them all. Note also they have a GF menu (one of my friends is strictly GF) which is mostly selections from the regular menu with perhaps a few tweaks here and there. \n","\n","Watermelon and feta salad was very tasty but probably my least favourite dish. It's a fairly uninspiring combo you see in many restaurants these days but certainly the flavours are delicious and it was a nice refreshing option.\n","\n","Black cod was the most perfectly cooked piece of fish I've had. It was so moist and sat atop a turnip cake that was crisp yet creamy. Definitely a must order.\n","\n","Top Chef Green Curry chicken is another must order, we were blown away by the presentation, the smells, and finally the taste. It was spicy yet cool and big pieces of chicken rather than the smaller curries you get in most asian restaurants.\n","\n","Finally the Singaporean Slaw, completely lived up to the hype. We almost ordered 2, our server talked us out of it but I think in the end we all regretted not having more. What a symphony of textures and flavours (I know how annoying that sounds but it's true). I wish I could eat it everyday. Tangy, sour, bitter, sweet, salty, all played a role.\n","\n","Regret not trying the cheeseburger spring rolls. Next time.\n","\n","I met Susur once at Reposado on Ossington. Such a nice guy and we even shared a tequila shot. I'm now officially a huge fan. Guess I've got to head over to Bent soon!\n","before I was here for brunch with girlfriends in September and had an overall good experience. \n","\n","I don't think this spot is known for brunch necessarily but it is a big space and was able to accommodate a larger group as well as my girlfriend's stroller. We were there to meet her new baby girl!\n","\n","Most of us went with the omelette of the day which had chicken, roasted veggies and cheddar cheese. I excluded the chicken because I find chicken with eggs a difficult concept to overcome. The omelette was really delicious, we all cleaned our plates. Rye toast on the side and a small green salad were just enough to finish the meal. \n","\n","Service was on point, refilling tea and coffee promptly. I would definitely return!\n","before I keep coming back to Sabai Sabai because the food is so fantastic, well priced, staff are friendly and the experience is so pleasant. \n","\n","I was there last night with my sister and went with the squash fritters, massaman curry (both of which are not to be missed), the street noodles and for something different we went for the pork skewers which I'd never tried. Everything was so flavourful and the pork skewers were a nice meaty choice to compliment the starchiness of the other dishes. For 4 dishes between the 2 of us (which was more than enough food) it came to $40 which is so reasonable. I love that you can get such variety which is my favourite way to eat. \n","\n","Also worth noting, last time I was here I left my phone in the bathroom. I didn't realize until about an hour later when I got home. They had found it and set it aside until I was able to return later that evening. Really great people working at Sabai Sabai!\n","before Came here last night with the husband and had a very positive experience. It was our wedding anniversary and we wanted to recreate a fabulous dim sum meal we had in Hong Kong during our honeymoon. Needless to say it didn't live up to that epic feast but it was absolutely delicious.\n","\n","We had their specialty soup-filled pork dumpings, pan fried pork dumplings, onion pancake roll with beef, wontons in spicy peanut sauce, and green beans with dried shrimp. The pancake roll was so yummy and even better when dipped in a bit of vinegar to cut the fat. The true star however was the wontons in spicy peanut sauce, I've never had anything like it (waiter said it's another specialty of theirs), the sauce was spicy creamy and nutty and the wontons had a deliciously tender skin and yummy pork filling.\n","\n","Everything was delivered in a very timely fashion - in fact I would stagger our order more next time so that we have more time between dishes. However it was all hot, with the desired accompaniments (some vinegar, chili oil etc.) and some ice cold Tsingtao to wash it all down. \n","\n","Worth noting near the end of our meal there was a lady yelling for the manager at the back of the room. She was relentless and tried to force her way into the back of the kitchen but the staff dealt with the situation very professionally. Our waiter apologized to us for the disruption rather than ignoring it which I appreciated. \n","\n","Total cost was around $70 for quite a lot of food (and a doggy bag), it's also much cleaner than most Chinatown restaurants. \n","\n","We will return!\n","before I just bit into a staple in my RCK Original box. Sorry but I won't be returning to RCK!\n","before This isn't entirely fair, I just popped in for a samosa today over lunch. Worst samosa I've ever had, should have taken a picture. I actually didn't mind that it was baked not fried, but it was under baked, mangled, luke warm, not spicy, and the veggies inside were sad.\n","before I think Gusto may be one of my favourite restaurants in the city. The ambiance is always so fun and boisterous but I don't find it too loud. You feel like you're part of a scene there and everyone seems to be having such a good time. That may be the $1\\/oz wine on tap - which is not bad at all! The rooftop bar patio is a great place to spend a summer apres work.\n","I don't love the no reservations thing but I believe for a larger group there is some accommodating. \n","For food, I love the kale salad and I'm not generally on the kale bandwagon, the spinach pizza with ricotta is fantastic, bolognese is rich and filling in a good way, and the meatball pizza is a nice change to the usual salami. For lunch I also like having the kale salad with some shrimps or chicken on the side. \n","Sister restaurant Nervosa in Yorkville is equally good food but the environment is lacking in comparison.\n","before Sorry but it was one traumatic experience and I won't be back.\n","\n","Couple of years ago I went in to get my hair coloured. They had a binder full of magazine clippings to help you pick out a shade. I found a nice light brown on some celeb and after an hour I came out looking like Barbie. This resulted in several treatments of \"toning\" the colour back down which ultimately left my hair feeling damaged and brassy.\n","\n","Won't go back again. I do love Aveda products though!\n","before This isn't the fanciest of vets but the staff are really helpful and very sweet with the animals. Dr. Thind has a calming disposition and makes me and my dog feel at ease when we are there. She also goes out of her way to avoid piling on the costs, preferring to wait and see where appropriate. We have been to see her after an unknown illness\\/injury as well as an infection and he has bounced back within a couple of weeks. I highly recommend this animal hospital for your pets!\n","before No secret that my husband and I love burritos, it's a kind of addiction. I have my favourites (Chorizo in the burbs, and Bandidos downtown) but lately I've been all about the burrito bowl from Chipotle. \n","\n","Most burrito joints I go for bean and cheese, with all of the fillings I tend to find the meat takes over (plus I'm getting some protein in the beans), but Chipotle's steak has really impressed me. It's always perfectly cooked with some pink on the inside! The reason I go for the bowl here is that they don't grill the burritos so I find the tortilla a bit too chewy and unnecessary on the calorie front. The bowl comes with rice (white or brown - I usually go for white), beans (black for me), salsa (the spicy red tomatillo is truly fantastic, hot but super flavourful as well), and then lettuce, cheese, sour cream, and I pay the RIDICULOUS 2.25 for guacamole too. To me guac is a necessary burrito topping and should be included everywhere.\n","\n","Anyways this is a super filling meal but incredibly tasty. You can split it over two meals for sure and at least you rest easy knowing the ingredients are fresh and the meat is local. \n","\n","I'm a regular at the Front St. location but I have to say the Yonge location, albeit way busier, has better service. \n","\n","Final thought: my husband has the app and it's really handy to pre-order if you're going during a busy time! You can head right to the cash to grab and go.\n","before 2* isn't an entirely fair representation of the food but it was for the experience. We were here for New Years Eve. There was an $80 prix fixe menu that had great selection - I had french onion soup to start, the filet mignon (medium-rare) for my main, and a creme brulee for dessert. The food was very good, and the bread was phenomenal. However this was NYE and they really missed the mark on making it a special occasion. I've been to other nice steakhouses for NYE before and we got the tiaras and noise makers, and the restaurant did a countdown at midnight with a glass of champagne. We had none of that here - a few noisemakers came out when we made the request. The staff made it clear that they didn't want to be there, it wasn't exactly the special evening we were expecting. \n","\n","I also think, with the price point, you're just as well off going to the Keg for your steak dinner.\n","before Lately I'm favouring the brown rice chicken teriyaki bowl from Freshii for lunch. It is a very large portion for under $8, and they keep portions of sriracha at the cash - get one and add it into your bowl, it adds some very necessary heat! Without it the dish is very one note, sweet teriyaki is all you taste.\n","\n","I love this option which is just as tasty as Teriyaki Experience but even healthier due to the brown rice (which in my opinion tastes even better and nuttier!) The veggies it comes with are broccoli, carrot and mushrooms but I sub edamame for the mushrooms. Yum!\n","before Such a tasty fresh lunch spot! As others have said it's like going home for lunch.\n","\n","I have had their sandwiches, usually turkey or tuna and they have a great selection of fresh breads and vegetables to top with. \n","\n","The real star however is the 2 or 3 salad combo. The 3 salads comes to around $7 after tax and they always have a great selection. I favour the greek pasta or tuna pasta salad and then couscous and the arugala\\/beet\\/feta\\/pecan. You can really tell that they make them fresh that day. I always feel satisfied but not overly \"full\" afterwards which is perfect. \n","\n","I also love their spinach pies (basically a spanakopita) for 3.99.  With a side salad it too makes a perfect lunch.\n","\n","Make sure to check out the soups while you're there too, the red lentil is especially tasty.\n","\n","Free WiFi! Couch and comfortable chairs!\n","\n","Note: someone mentioned no debit? They definitely DO have debit.\n","before I work near the original location on Adelaide so I have been many times before, and now I live close to this Queen St.W location which is fantastic for these cold miserable days we've been having.\n","\n","As a long time lover of Indian food and flavours there is something so satisfying about Ravi's apricot and red lentil soup. Ordered by itself you get one of the best biscuits I've ever had, flaky and buttery, with some of the best red pepper jelly I've ever had. They're also a perfect accompaniment as the soup serving is not enough to satisfy me on it's own. I have tried the chicken hot pot as well and the noodles are the star of that dish, along with the bok choy (a fave vegetable of mine) but I tend to go for the rich creamy lentils every time.\n","\n","On the wrap front, you can't get much tastier than the curried lamb wrap. I also love the chicken wrap (which is quite similar with the addition of chipotle mayo instead of mango pineapple salsa. The lamb however is so perfectly cooked it just melts in your mouth. What Ravi does best in every dish is the marrying of flavours, sweet and spicy, hot and cold. The soup and wrap combo for 10.99 is an incredibly filling lunch and great value if you're hungry.\n","\n","4 out of 5 stars is because I find them somewhat inconsistent especially between the two locations. Sometimes I have had edamame beans in the chicken wrap for instance, and gone to the Adelaide location to find none (they add a nice texture in the wrap too so I was disappointed).  \n","\n","Regardless, I think they're up to 3 locations total now and I hope they continue to expand!\n","before Hurts me to do this - I'm sure it was just a fluke but today my fried chicken was legitimately burnt and the wrap to my taco was beyond stale, it was so hard it wouldn't fold. Really disappointing lunch experience.\n","\n","Who am I kidding though, I'll be back.\n","before Agree with some others RE: the service. It's spotty.\n","\n","Sometimes you go in and the guy behind the counter is your best friend, very complimentary (if sometimes a little too friendly with the ladies). Today however I went in for a little snack, the falafel appetizer. It came to $1.50 and I realized I had no change, took out my debit card and he says \"No way, it's a $5 minimum\", \"I don't have any cash\" I responded, to which he said \"not my problem - get out\". \n","\n","Nice to know he'd smothered them in tahini already for me - good luck reselling that.\n","\n","The food is decent, there is way better in the city. The falafel especially can be disappointing as they fry a bunch at a time and serve them up cold very often. The sandwiches do get pressed briefly to warm them up but it certainly takes away from the warm\\/crisp of a freshly fried falafel ball. \n","\n","Go elsewhere. Liberty Shawarma (Spadina or in Liberty Village) is the best.\n","before Am I crazy? Or are all of you? \n","\n","These rotis taste like a bunch of chicken bouillon cubes and water with some meat swimming in it. The skin\\/shell wasn't even that tender, chewy, or tasty.\n","\n","Granted I'm partial to east Indian rotis but this place is near where I live so I had to see what the fuss was all about. Sincerely disappointed, it's just curry powder and chicken base, salty and boring in my opinion.\n","\n","Sorry! Won't be back, I'll stick with the pinnacle of all rotis (Mother India\\/Gandhi Roti).\n","before Quick review for my hair dresser Alicia! I love John Steinberg salon and not just because of it's convenient location. They are so friendly in there and it's always cozy and comfortable whether you're waiting or getting your hair did.\n","Alicia does a great job with both cut and colour and I have complete trust in her which is always nice.\n","If you're looking to switch up your hair salon - give them a try!\n","before Food was decent but the delivery guy was a total creep. When I called to order he was sounding very strange on the phone making moaning noises. When the food arrived I made my boyfriend go to the door to get the food and he was asking how the pretty girl was doing tonight etc. \n","\n","This was the first time we had ordered from there so I'd never met any of the employees - it was just plain weird. Certainly enough to never order from there again. \n","\n","GO TO or CALL TRIMURTI next door - the food is fabulous, best samosas I've ever had and they also deliver. Dal Makhani is also a winner.\n","before Went here with some colleagues for some cocktails and bites. The interior design is lovely and the location is great, across the street from Dupont station. \n","\n","Fancy cocktails aren't really my thing, I'd rather a glass of wine or a beer but I did enjoy my gin cocktail \"The Sun Also Rises\". \n","\n","We shared the salt cod croquettes which were tasty, like a crab cake, but I didn't find there was enough cod flavour it was a bit potato-y. We also had some tasty olives, bread, and a cheese that I can't remember but was served with honey and baguette. \n","\n","All in all a nice spot but not my cup of wine.\n","before I was here on Saturday for a birthday party, it was my second time here (the first being a few years ago) and thoroughly enjoyed the experience! \n","\n","We were a group of approx 12 people so we had 2 tables reserved - if you have a group I highly recommend making a reservation and getting there early! Our reservation was for 7pm and I realized later on why it was so necessary - this place gets PACKED on the weekend. \n","\n","As for the food we ordered 3 different times and each time got around 6 sausages, curry wvrst style (sauce on the side), I think this is the way to go in a group because I got to try almost every sausage on the menu! I think in a smaller group it's nice to get a full sausage on the bun because I like the toppings (sauerkraut and jalapenos please!) but with a group this worked out really well. My favourites were (in order): TAMWORTH , BERKSHIRE, KRANJSKA (tastes like a super high quality hot dog!), BOEREWORS, CHORIZO. We tried others but those were tops, I did try Bison and Kangaroo but wasn't thrilled on either - the kangaroo was especially dry, it's too lean of a meat. \n","\n","We also had orders of plain duck fat fries, and the dirty duck fat fries. I loved the dirty fries, curry sauce and jalapenos were so good and the fries managed to stay crispy! \n","\n","The beer selection is intimidating but the bartender was very helpful and even gave me a couple of samples. I settled on the Pilsner Urquell for the night and really enjoyed it, nice easy compliment to all of that meat. \n","\n","My only complaints are: very crowded - I couldn't believe there was a line out the door from about 8pm-11pm, and the crowd resulted in a very loud and VERY hot room. I understand it's winter but I didn't need to sweat on top of my meat sweats. \n","\n","Anyways a great spot for a birthday gathering and I'd happily go back!\n","before Tacos are delicious and worth the hype. Baja fish was probably my favourite, absolutely loved the guacamole - addition of julienned radish on the top was a very nice touch for crunch and tang. I think the spicy pork was my second favourite taco, I love the crema on top to cool the spice just a bit.\n","\n","Sampled some other items including the ceviche - very good but a bit too saucy, pig ear lettuce wraps - surprisingly good and a bit nutty in flavour? and the bourbonade - a definite recommendation for cocktails! We shared 2 pitchers between 4 people. \n","\n","I will be back! Possibly try the take-out next time, it was definitely loud in there and not exactly comfortable seating but the food makes it worth your while!\n","before Highly recommend Good Karma Cleaning!\n","\n","I was interested in a one-time spring cleaning and so many services I contacted wanted to go through a lengthy phone call about our space and expectations etc. Good Karma had a very well thought out online form and I was contacted by email - my preferred method - later the same day. \n","\n","We had a 3 hour cleaning, all you need to provide is a vacuum\\/swiffer, mop and a roll of paper towels. I was working from home the day she came but stayed in our second bedroom\\/office which didn't need a cleaning. She worked so hard and so fast to cover our entire condo. I was thrilled with the result. I might end up indulging in this service more often!\n","before Ok final update on Dundas Spring Garden. I think they've earned their place back in my good books. \n","\n","This is still our go to for Chinese delivery. Always through Tasteaway (do a google search for promo codes! I always get at least 15% off!)\n","\n","Go-to order is: Spring Rolls, Singapore Fried Vermicelli, Sichuan Crispy Shredded Beef, Steamed Rice, General Tso chicken. \n","\n","Still looking for another chicken dish, General Tso can be hit or miss, but the chicken balls are a definite MISS. Not sure how they fail here but the rest of the food is quite yummy and gives me my fix.\n","before First time sitting inside which was quite loud, you're much better off sitting in their gorgeous patio. It's like being in someone's beautiful backyard for a bbq with way better food than your friends could ever cook.\n","\n","We always get the same thing at Bairrada - start with the flaming sausage and some shrimps in that amazing garlic butter sauce. You're missing out if you don't sop up the garlic butter and some of those chorizo juices with the bread. \n","\n","Main course is always a big garden salad (so simple yet so perfect, onion cucumber peppers iceberg and tomato in a house vinegarette) and the BBQ chicken with rice and potatoes. What on earth do they do to those potatoes to make them so delicious. They're perfectly cooked and that oil on them is delicious. Chicken is always nicely prepared with crispy skin and juicy meat. \n","\n","To top everything off, and I mean I put it on everything, their peri peri sauce is not too spicy but certainly not mild. It's what sets them apart for sure.\n","\n","Summer is coming, next time I'll be outside!\n","before Went here for my birthday lunch with some colleagues. \n","\n","I had the Zia Rita pizza which seems like a very popular option. It comes with \"nduja sausage\", fire roasted onion, and rapini. I have recently discovered that I really love rapini. Especially on pizzas and in Italian sandwiches. It adds such a delicious bitter green note and it remains firm unlike a standard lettuce green. \n","\n","The crust was perfect Neopolitan style, chewy and thin. The sausage was very tasty, I love when sausage on a pizza is not sliced from a casing but rather freely presented around the za.\n","\n","I'd put this pizza up against a Terroni, Libretto, or Piola pizza any day. Service left a little to be desired, it wasn't busy at all that day and yet it took awhile to be seated, order, receive drinks, and receive our food. Almost as though because it wasn't busy the servers were in no rush at all.\n","\n","If the food is what matters most however, they are a great option in a part of town where Chinese dumplings, Vietnamese subs\\/pho dominate. If you're feeling like some casual Italian I'd recommend Strada 241.\n","before Went to Richmond Station with some girlfriends in June. I was really excited to try it out as I had heard good things about the restaurant, and more importantly I was a huge fan of Carl Heinrich on Top Chef Canada!\n","\n","The waitress was very helpful in assisting us with the wine menu, she even brought us a couple of tastes to help us decide! We ended up with a delicious and well priced Sauvignon Blanc which complimented our food very well. \n","\n","The food I thought was a bit over priced, hence the 4\\/5 stars. I had the Station burger which Carl is said to have brought over from Marben when he worked there. The burger was basically perfect, medium rare with a soft and not-too-big milk bun. I was very pleased that they accommodated my picky side and gave me half fries half salad as well (PS why don't more restaurants offer this straight up?)\n","\n","One of my friends got 2 salads as her main, a nice option but she left feeling hungry. I will be back as there are some other items I would love to try. As far as execution and service goes, they were spot on.\n","before A-Ok! I work nearby and stopped in for some all you can eat lunch with my husband yesterday. I have been a few times before but it had been a long time. \n","\n","12.99 each for the AYCE and they had a very good selection. We got our money's worth with a few rolls (spicy salmon, shrimp tempura, butterfish), some nigiri (salmon, butterfish), green salads, miso soup, delicious green tea.\n","\n","It was an enjoyable experience, friendly and attentive service (although they weren't very busy) and quality fish and not too much rice (a sushi pet peeve). I'd return but it's wasn't anything I haven't had elsewhere.\n","before My finace and I are devastated that we recently moved out of the delivery area for Spadina Garden. Best Chinese delivery in the city bar none.\n","\n","Get the crispy ginger beef and the spicy peanut chicken plus a white rice. I could eat it at least weekly. Maybe their dishes are too saucy but it's Canadian Chinese food, that's how they do. Scrape some off or let the steamed rice soak it up.\n","\n","We often got the Singapore noodles as well which were standard but tasty, had a nice curry flavour going on.\n","\n","It's not cheap but we would always get at least 2 meals out of it so it's justifiable.\n","\n","If you're in the delivery area - please take advantage for my sake.\n","before Was here in March with some colleagues for an early dinner and really enjoyed the food and atmosphere! \n","\n","The decor is very cool, Korean\\/Mexican\\/hipster which should be my nightmare but I dug it. \n","\n","We shared kalbi ribs and guacamole to start and I think they're both must-orders. The kalbi ribs were deliciously tender and had a nice Korean bbq marinade (sweet, salty, tangy). The guac didn't last long, chips were a bit overly salted but actually when paired with the guac it was balanced. \n","\n","For tacos I had 1 crispy taco with braised short rib, and 1 baja fish. I loved both of them, but would probably pick the short rib over the baja fish next time even though it was quite messy. The shell didn't crumble as much as your old el paso would and the short rib jus had some deep flavour. Two of my colleagues had a crispy chicken taco and I was admittedly jealous - it will be ordered next time, they raved about it and it seemed to be a popular pick on other tables at the restaurant.\n","\n","I found the service to be lacking, our waitress was hard to get a hold of and we waited quite awhile for drink orders to be taken and delivered once we had arrived (it was a pretty mean margarita though - not lacking on the tequila). \n","\n","Worth a visit if you like playa cabana!\n","before Tandoori Chicken kebab is so delicious! It is spicy but very tolerable. I have had it with rice and without rice, more than enough food to skip the rice though. The salad that it comes with is standard (cucumber, tomato, iceberg, dressing; coleslaw on the side). I ask for more coleslaw usually and they're happy to oblige.\n","\n","The hot sauce they give you is unlike any I've had elsewhere, it is more of a salsa but don't let it fool you, it brings the heat! Ask for the white sauce as well (I think it's the salad dressing but I noticed a lot of regulars ask for a side of the white sauce), it helps cool down the spice. \n","\n","The Afghan naan is so delicious, I've gone in and had it as a snack before (only .99). Fairly pricey but knock the rice off the menu and my meal is under $10! Not bad.\n","\n","As others have said, you will wait approx. 10min for your meal during weekday lunch hour.\n","before Dr. Hibberd did my braces and I couldn't be happier! Hibberd Orthodontics is the best of the best - such a beautiful office with really friendly staff, I always felt so comfortable there. You are in the best hands with Dr. Hibberd and I'm sure you will be as pleased with the results as I am. I have had so many compliments on my teeth and smile since I had my braces removed. I highly recommend!!\n","before Was here late last year and am sorry to say I wasn't thrilled with it! I had very high expectations given the reputation and expansion of the brand. Ambiance was vibrant which I enjoyed but the food underwhelmed me. I love neopolitan style pizza and thankfully there's a lot of options in the city. \n","\n","They have all the right components here (italian tomatoes, quality house cheese, high gluten flour for the pizza) but I was missing a chew and a slight crisp in the crust. We shared the prosciutto appetizer and some olives to start, then I went with the \"house-made sausage\" pizza. It was a white pizza with caramelized onion, mozzarella and chili oil. Ingredients were tasty but the crust was just too soft, dare I say a bit soggy. Wine list was solid and we enjoyed a nice bottle of primitivo. No dessert on this occasion.\n","\n","I would like to go back and give the calamari appetizer a try, it looks pretty delicious on yelp. I'll let you know if my review improves.\n","before I have worked in the area for years and tried a number of lunch items. Everything always tastes very homemade and high quality! \n","\n","Soups are always delicious - Carrot ginger is a favourite, and they always come with a piece of bread for dipping.\n","Cobb salad is excellent, they are pre prepared but come with a creamy and tangy blue cheese dressing on the side.\n","Quiche with greens - my favourite lunch which I get fairly often from Le Gourmand. They always have 2 or 3 types (ham and cheddar, goat cheese and roasted veg, smoked salmon and dill are all common options). With greens it comes to 6.99 which is well worth it, the pastry is flaky and buttery and the portion size is very fair.\n","\n","They also always have hot lunch specials (lasagna, curries, meatloaf etc.) and a range of sandwiches that can be put in a panini press.\n","\n","Finally you can't go without grabbing a cookie, particularly the chocolate chip w\\/walnut are the best cookies in the city without a doubt. I think they're around $2ea but I would pay 3 no problem. They are crispy outside and gooey inside just like you would attempt to make at home but fail! \n","\n","Give it a go if you're in the area, they also have a nice little patio area on Spadina.\n","before As a business owner(of a salon), I have worked with several plumbers over the last 5 years. In Los Angeles I have dealt with drunk plumbers(during the day!), late arrivals(waited over 2 hrs), and flat out lies that ended up costing me way too much money. Freddy answers his phone, is polite, prompt and knowledgeable. He fixed the mess a previous plumber made and charged me a very fair price. The next time I called, he was just as helpful as before. I will be using his services from now on. It's GREAT to find a professional you can trust!!\n","before Do you know how you can tell when someone just really doesn't enjoy their job? That describes our waiter's attitude perfectly. He was polite, but I had the distinct feeling that he wanted to be anywhere else but there. Sad. We won't be back.\n","before Having heard about the opening on Twitter, I nipped in on opening night to see what Clerk's Bar had to offer, and, like Alan S, was pleasantly surprised.\n","\n","I'm not, generally speaking, a pubs person myself, least of all for pubs with sports on the screen, but Clerk's has a dash of difference. The two screens (one showing a Champions League footie match on STV, the other showing a different footie match on Sky Sports) were well-placed such that you could position yourself most places in the bar and still get a decent view, added to which the sound on the STV match was up loud enough that it was audible over the chatter (I find commentary one of the most interesting parts of watching sports on telly, so in bars it's normally pointless for me).\n","\n","Already well-populated by those in the know and quick off the mark, the place was already thriving with a lovely warm atmosphere; I only just managed to get a stool at the bar. Big tick for the bar stools, by the way - sturdy, in heavy cast iron with good solid wooden seat-tops that spin around for adjustable height (and for ease of fun swivelling).\n","\n","The decor is stylish, in a woodeny kind of way, with some seriously cool lightbulbs over the bar (zig-zaggy filament joy) and the staff at the bar were really friendly despite the fact that business was pretty steady and they weren't getting much chance to rest. The menu looks really great - lovely slow-cooked things, burritos, burgers, smoked yumness... I'd love to have tried something but I'd just eaten, will definitely head back to give it a go as it really seems my kind of place. If they're showing the snooker World Champs, I must just end up living there!\n","before Point the first: the shop is a working shop devoted to marshmallows and also stocking the finest in local artisan confectionery (Pinnies \u0026 Poppyseeds shortcake, Edward \u0026 Irwyn chocolate) - no longer any cafe element to it. Kitchen visible. Packaging stacked neatly on the shelves. Icing sugar tramped charmingly from till to window over the otherwise pristine shop floor.\n","Point the second: it's vintage and cutesy without being kitsch or saccharine. The colours are very slightly brighter and more vibrant than the oh-so-trendy macaron\\/candyfloss shades you're seeing everywhere at the moment.\n","Point the third: They have a framed picture of Mr StayPuft.\n","Point the fourth: Sean, aka Mr Toontrait, the chirpy fun chappy who served me, seemed to be 100% in love with the shop and I could have stuck around chatting about marshmallows and his illustrations (he did the logo) for hours.\n","Point the fifth: those marshmallows though. UNFFFFF. Uh. May. ZING.\n","before Nothing to do with little flutes - piccolo is Italian for small, which suits this Mondrian delight on the south-eastern corner of Grassmarket perfectly. Primary coloured benches surround three sides of a table in the window, unsinkably cheerful - rather like the proprietor (who, for the sake of clarity, does not surround three sides of a table by the window). I had a delicious panini - I can't remember precisely what was in it; bacon and some other things but they had me at bacon. It was perfectly done - fluffy yet crispy and generously filled, but not overly so. There's a good range on the menu, from droolworthy-sounding focaccias to a couple of really lovely soups. My partner for lunch that day had the vegetable soup and I'm told it was... brace yourselves... soup-erb. (Thank you, thank you...)\n","\n","You pick up your soft drinks from the fridge, and it's £1.50 for a can, which you might wince at if it were a vending machine but which seems reasonable in a cafe. The fact that you pick them up them yourself and they're still in a can does kind of emphasise the markup, though, despite the fact that we were later brought glasses to decant them into.\n","\n","However, the touch I really liked was - oddly - paying. Apparently, they had ordered the wrong kind of card machine - one that has to plug into a telephone point instead of a wireless one - so I had to toddle on through the back door and into the kitchen to pay. Seems funny, but that little touch of character and quirk actually made it for me! I really hope they keep it that way.\n","before My nearest shop - which takes me one minute and 42 seconds to get to from my door (yes, I timed it, I totally am that person) is Tesco Express. And, as I mentioned in my review, I have issues with Tesco Express in that it's 3p more for a Wispa than it is at a Tesco Metro or other competing supermarket of similar size. But I also have issues with laziness, and when it's the choice between walking for less than two minutes or for a whole FOUR to get to the Co-op, I'm afraid I often wimp out.\n","\n","But I'm always so glad when I don't, because for one thing, the Co-op is a co-op; ethically the polar opposite to Tescoid. For another, it's larger and better stocked. It also has an Amazon Locker to which you can get your stuff delivered if you're going to be out, assuming it's of an amenable size.\n","\n","The staff are super-friendly and I always find what I want, plus they have a good line in Fair Trade choc. Go Co-op!\n","before The single most important thing to note is: punny pizza. Seriously, that's a menu and a half. \"Pepperoni Don't Preach\" - \"Tuna Turner\" - \"Frankie Goes to Holyrood\" (that one's got haggis)... on and on it goes!\n","\n","After this, there are several other quite important things, and they are this:\n","Holy moly the onion rings (thanks to Paddy H for that!). Also, it is nice and warm. There are big squidgy sofas and nice cuddly booths. The playlist is epic. They have album art on the walls. Free wifi. Big space.\n","\n","I came here a while ago when I was still in my previous life all Fringe-ified, and was much enamoured of the pizza menu then, too, but didn't really get a chance to take it all in. Now I have, and I like it, and I shall return.\n","\n","Because oh yes £1 pizzas on a Monday - that's for a margarita and then a little more for each topping. Bring me the cheesy goodness, NOW.\n","before Yep, it's busy. It's so busy. As I slip in through the door, a young woman sliding out from behind a tiny table near the counter gives me a nod, conspiratorial, comforting. I smile in relief and prepare my bag for being quickly dumped as soon as she vacates. The world and its dog is here.\n","\n","But there is a reason - many, in fact - that it's so close to impossible to get a seat sometimes - it's that Freemans is the real deal. They know coffee and so, rightly, they are known for coffee. They've also got a range of rather stunning-looking eatables, and I was delighted to get to try a white hot chocolate (which, as many of you will have picked up by now, is my holy grail) with vanilla and lemongrass. Holy moly, that was good.\n","\n","It's light and the bare wood manages to be chic without being too hipsterish. You'd predict cool alt\\/indie music but they keep things upbeat (or at least, when I've been in) with a more unexpected dancey mix. Also they are dog-friendly and have a big bowl of water inside for the canine companions, so provided you're not averse to the joyful greetings of a shaggy friend or two, this is a fine, fine place to be.\n","\n","A couple of minor hitches dock that final star: last time I was in, the young lady zooming to and fro past me seemed deaf to my timid \"excuse me\"s as I tried to ask for the wifi password. (Oh, yes, there's wifi too) - I assumed, probably correctly, that I wasn't being heard over the throngs and the pumping music, but when I toddled up to the counter and asked again while she was standing still (in the process of making a coffee), there was definitely no response. When she'd finished, I got a curt \"yes?\". Just a simple \"hold on a sec\" in the meantime would have been nice... Also, password having been obtained, I couldn't actually connect to the wifi in the end - connection timeouts everywhere. I ended up hotspotting from my phone so no real problem.\n","\n","But really, the main point is that I got my work done and had a lovely time while doing it. Generally speaking, Freemans is the bomb, and it appeals to all demographics: young, trendy professionals; yummy mummies; older folks hunting out a tasty lunch spot and chatter on a sunny Marchmont afternoon... Whoever you are, don't come here in the early afternoon if you want a quiet chillout with a cup of tea or a Skype call. But do come here - any time of day - if you want energy, vibrancy, a seriously cool atmosphere, and some truly kickass coffee (I'm told) or sandwiches (I guess from the look of them) or hot chocolate (I know first-hand).\n","before Quite possibly the most beautiful street in all of Edinburgh, this elegant, curving, twin-layered goddess of a thoroughfare is perfectly placed to catch the light at the best time of the day. Its shops are a jamboree of colour and variety - book shop, pig shop, tweed shop, map shop, juice shop, dress shop, red, blue, pink, green. Up until recently it even featured a Christmas shop, and landed itself a starring role in the film adaptation of Filth.\n","\n","I absolutely love this street, but I must confess to never having bought anything other than comestibles from it. I walk past Walker Slater every time with an aching heart and a longing eye, but I might as well be wishing for a platinum pony.\n","\n","All the same, I often take a slightly longer route down Victoria Street and back up Candlemaker Row instead of straight over George IV Bridge, just for the pleasure of walking down this beautiful street.\n","before Biblos, as Ian A so rightly points out, is the kind of place you walk past a bajillion times before you actually realise you should probably check it out. I walked past it on a twice daily basis for the best part of a year (I was going somewhere, I should add - I wasn't just walking past to gaze in longingly) and now, long after I stopped walking past it, the opportunity arose as we hunted a post-show drink. Watching ice-dancing is enthralling but also you leave the performance feeling like you've been holding your breath for two hours straight and now seriously need to relax.\n","\n","So we sauntered to the nearby Biblos. What to say, what to say. There was a sign on the wall saying that the upstairs space was reserved, but on asking it apparently wasn't, so we went up. It has a nice interior and I was very comfortable, and I even actually took my actual coat off. Yes, the Lizard Woman was warm enough!\n","\n","But on the down side, it took a long time for anyone to come and take our order (oh he came around to gather up and whisk away the food menus, and when we said \"we would like to order some drinks\" he just waved the menus at us as though to say \"Not my division. I'm on gathering duty right now.\"\n","\n","When we did order, it took a fair while to come. Now then, there were really not that many of us - seven if I recall correctly - and most of the upstairs was empty, so why it should take so long to concoct our round (which included a lime and soda and a diet Coke; not the most challenging) is a mystery. The arrival itself was also slightly confused and flustered.\n","\n","Nevertheless, it's well located and comfortable, so it's far from being a write off. Ditch the TV (look, I love the IT Crowd, but seriously, what is the point of showing a sitcom with no sound? Football, yes, snooker, fine, but something that relies on dialogue?), whip up the service a bit, and they could have a real winner here. I worry that the good location excuses a little laziness; not for me it doesn't.\n","before People, you - you do realise how awesome this street is, right? Right? I've heard people complain about the fact that there are shops only on one side. But - you guys! That's the whole point! That's the joy of it!\n","\n","Instead of a generic shopping street that could be any old place in the world, you have all your usual chains and everything for which the regular high-street fashionista could wish, with the added joy of dazzling views over the gardens and across to the Old Town.\n","\n","You get the gothic majesty of the Walter Scott Monument framed against the spires and turrets of Assembly Hall and St Giles' Cathedral.\n","\n","You get wide pavements to help you in navigating the throngs, and plenty of crossings in the street to take you over to the gallery or the gardens.\n","\n","You get something different from the streets that house these shops in other cities all over the UK.\n","\n","So why on earth would anyone want shops on the other side as well? I can't think of a single chain shop that's missing from Princes Street. Sure, it would be lovely to see some independent shops stake a claim in one of the black empty shopfronts in this currently somewhat snaggle-toothed row, but equally, one goes to Princes Street knowing what one wants, not in the spirit of exploration and creativity which inspires an indy spree - it serves an entirely different purpose, and serves it solidly and with pretty pictures opposite.\n","\n","The only downside to this arrangement is the tourist type that walks along just in front of you and then stops dead in his\\/her tracks, camera aloft, as though only having just noticed the castle. Still, that's one way to meet to people...\n","before Yelpers descended on Ong Gie feeling all ready and raring to have some barbecue fun. I, however, being of the school of thought that one goes out for dinner to AVOID cooking, opted not to join my tablemates in the barbecue line of things but instead went for the fried chicken in sweet chilli sauce, which had a really great Korean sounding name on the menu but which, in retrospect and when I write it out like that, sounds devastatingly plebeian.\n","\n","As it happens, I think I might have made a mistake, since I'm told that the barbecue was really quite marvellous, and there were lots of colours involved, which is normally a good sign. My chicken tasted lovely but was rather tough going, with very chewy batter. If I hadn't ordered a side of rice then it would have become monotonous very quickly as the vegetables' flavours were drowned out by the sauce. Not that it wasn't very tasty, but it was just all a bit heavy and glutenous.\n","\n","I was a bit alarmed by the safety of the barbecue setup; I always laugh at signs that say \"caution: hot\" on obviously hot things, but the noticeable absence of warning on the open skillets set into the tables was surprising. In addition, the hotplate ran off mains power, which meant that the cable trailed under the table and swung perilously a few inches off the ground like a tripwire between the table and the wall-socket, which the people sitting on the other side of the table had to be careful to notice and avoid when getting in and out.\n","\n","Finally, when I buy a soft drink for a considerable mark-up in a restaurant, it's always easier to push the usual mark-up out of my mind if it's not served as I'd find it in were I to buy it from a shop. The plastic bottle sitting on the table didn't seem to fit with the lovely restaurant vibe of the place.\n","\n","That said, the staff were stellar; one very cheerful and helpful young woman came over to explain the barbecue process to my slightly mystified friends, and when one person's main was forgotten, a senior member of staff came over in person to apologise. Oh, and also, the menus are trimmed with super shiny shiny golden cord which was delightfully distracting and I wanted to take one home with me.\n","\n","So to sum up, Ong Gie has a lovely atmosphere and the evening as a whole was very enjoyable, and though I'm not sure I'd necessarily be in any undue hurry to return, I would certainly not object to the idea either.\n","before Oh, it's so very cool here - I love the bright walls and the wacky decoration (a stuffed antelope head on the wall adorned with a tacky tiara sums the place up pretty perfectly) and the retro arcade game. I also love the sense of space.\n","\n","The brunch menu is limited, and of the four options, two appealed to me: the Mary Moriarty (poached eggs and smoked salmon on a brioche bun) and the Eggs Irvine Welsh (scrambled with chorizo, I think). I plumped for the MM, but I was surprised to find the salmon cold. To be fair to them, it was clearly meant to be - not a case of \"outrage! My dish arrived cooled down!\" More a case of \"that's a bit odd, with hot eggs.\" Maybe just me, but I wasn't sure about it. The brioche bun was very nice - again not my expectation - I think of brioche as super soft and fluffy and this was toasted to rock-like crunch - but pleasant.\n","\n","Our waiter was very perky and achingly cool in style; big plus points for dealing with a confused rabble of brunch-hungry Yelpers on a Saturday morning with such efficiency and cheer.\n","\n","All in all, I had a lovely brunch, but I think much of that was related to the lovely company. I'll be happy to go back and try it again to see how it fares in a less brunchy situation because it really is a very nice spot.\n","before I like it here. No, hear me out - I do. The cosy booths and dim-ish lighting are just right for a mid-week night out and conversation with a couple of friends, and the music in our booth wasn't so loud as to drown out the converation.\n","\n","Their cocktail menu is confusing in a good kind of way; it has an inexplicably Back To The Future themed section. Why? No explanation was apparent. But if you have a cocktail called the Dr Emmett Brown then I'm not going complain just because I don't know why! Sadly, it's a rum slushy premix so there's no harmlesss equivalent, but the mocktail they did make for me, the Pink Panther Mocktail, was a lovely refreshing watermelon thingymajig with a giant lump of the fruit right there. (I'm a devout muncher of drink-fruits. I even chew the lemon slice from my tonic water. I heard it's not the done thing but I don't care; my excuse now is that I'm from the future.) The bar staff were pretty chirpy, too, if a little slow with our drinks, although it wasn't busy.\n","\n","So it's all pretty fine, but there is just this weird thing that they have two big televisions, one at either end of the room, so no matter which way you look, you'll see it. I imagine that's for football but there was no match on. My friends and I kept getting distracted by the screen and zoning out. It made conversation tricky and they weren't even showing Back To The Future! (That might actually have EARNED a star...) So yep, I'd come back here again happily, but I'm not in any particular hurry to do so.\n","before I LOVE CHRISTMAS! I am a Christmas bean. I start feeling Christmassy in October. I just... oooooh, I love it I love it I love it. It's the most wonderful time of the year. I'm infuriating to be around. I bounce everywhere. I - aw, hell, I flipping JINGLE.\n","\n","Alas. Heartbreak. Christmas has been put up for sale and now it has a logo. It's such a shame, because Edinburgh's Christmas as it is this year COULD be amazing, but it fails to add up to even half the sum of its parts.\n","\n","It's been widely reported that due to the organisers doubling the fee for a stall, many vendors from previous years were unable to return, and that those that could have put their prices up. I couldn't find a hugely noticeable difference between the craft vendors this year and last year; a few changes, but many things the same (little robot men, wooden nutcrackers, tea-light holders, cheese). The prices are indeed noticeably higher, but it's the comestibles where the event really falls down.\n","\n","The Beasts of Branding have descended. If you decide you want mulled wine, or mulled cider, there's no sense of spontaneity, because it's the same stall as the one a few yards further back. All that fun of exploration and discovery has turned into a sense of being channeled through a pathway designed to take your money and nothing else. No worries if you miss something here, it'll come along again a bit further.\n","\n","The corral-style enclosure up at St Andrew's Square, meanwhile, feels like the worse parts of the Fringe, with hordes cramped into a temporary structure designed for - well, just drinking. Consume and be gone. The ferris wheel is enclosed - no more chill winter winds, \"our cheeks are nice and rosy\", clinging to one another and squeaking in thrilled terror at the height of the thing. The Starflyer looks like excellent fun, and I nearly went on it, but I watched it a few times and seriously, it's not up there for very long. Not as long as I'd hope for £7.\n","\n","Then, down in \"Santa Land\", there's the £4 Christmas Tree Maze for kiddies. It looks super-pretty at night-time, all sparkly and lit up, but it doesn't look like much of a maze. I imagine it takes 5 minutes, tops, for any kid to find their way in and out solo. That said, I really love the Santa Train. Such a cute idea.\n","\n","Oh, it's such a shame. There really isn't much that saves the situation, this year. But I know that Underbelly are capable of doing some fabulous things so if they hang on to the contract for next year I hope they're able to take some of the criticisms on board, because beyond the hysteria of people just yelling \"IT'S RUBBISH\" (no, come on, folks, it isn't - did you SEE Milton Keynes' disaster this year? Perspective, in all things) there are some valid points being made that could see this turn into something really quite lovely. Consistency and coherence are not bad things, but when it comes to a sense of fun and Christmassy spirit, they have to be done right.\n","before What can I say? Hemma is where the heart is, and I think I left mine there!\n","\n","I read through some of the other reviews here before we plumped for Hemma on the strength of its being so near to my current flat (and I've been meaning to head there for ages) and I was a little tentative since the response seems so mixed.\n","\n","But all I can talk about personally is the experience that we ourselves had - and that experience was \"WOW!\" I came here for an impromptu lunch with my parents and all three of us got completely swept off our feet by the loveliness. \n","Their little manifesto on the front page of the drinks menu sums up the unique feel of this place; it's cheery, quirky, it's friendly and good-natured, and I love it.\n","\n","The food is fab value at just under a tenner for a decent main, and especially for the giant portions we got. I ordered the spaghetti with garlic chicken (£8.50) and the mountain of deliciousness that arrived was almost too much for me to finish, but equally, too good to leave. My parents were both equally thrilled with their meals - club sandwich for Dad, beef burger for Mum - and having nicked a couple of their seasoned fries, I can see why. I don't think I've ever encountered those fries' equal.\n","\n","Despite the somewhat intimidating and angular exterior, the decor within is homely enough to easily justify the name \"Hemma\", being comfy and mismatched, and the windows (which we at first glance had thought were some kind of chic stained-glass mosaic) are actually creatively decorated with slides.\n","\n","The thing I got most excited about was the awesome drinks menu; every single one of the impressive range of cocktails on offer is not only delicious-sounding but also wittily described, and for the meagre sum of £4, water-voles like me can order a custom mocktail instead. I can't wait to go back and try this one evening.\n","\n","Yep, they've definitely taken my heart hostage, and I've got full-blown Stockholm syndrome.\n","before This spot's pleasant enough; as a few here have said, it's far from mind-meltingly fabulous, but it must be doing something right to remain so busy (as it was) when there are so many other cafes and bars in the area.\n","\n","I think they must have finally updated the menu since Jenny L's review because one can now choose to have one's Eggs Benedict with spinach, ham, bacon or - for a wee bit extra - smoked salmon. My friend and I went for the classic and we were both delighted with the result. The muffin was toasted just enough to make it crispy without spoiling the fluffiness and the eggs were wonderfully hot (although so was the plate: yowchio! Warn me next time, please, waitress... I didn't spot your gloves until too late!)\n","\n","But - oh dear, Cafe Grande - there goes a star. There was no drinks menu in sight so we're still not entirely sure if a range of teas was available. The tea, once ordered, took a goodly while to arrive and we had to ask for extra sugar when it did, since there was only one sachet each. \n","\n","And - whoops - another. It's not a small place as such, but it feels a bit like they've tried to fit too many people in and so it's kind of cramped. I had to press myself in against the counter while paying so that people could get past and the lady on the till barely said a word to me and swapped over with someone else halfway through taking my payment! Pretty rude, I thought...\n","\n","So, nice enough for an impromptu brunch with a friend but not somewhere I'd necessarily make plans to go to.\n","before Two things led me to finally get my eyes checked out. The first, and one might reasonably assume most important, was certain episodes of blindness. The second, which was actually the trigger (don't judge me) was noticing a tendency to screw up my eyes very slightly when looking at my phone, and the realisation that, long term, this could give me WRINKLES. I'm now officially nearer to 30 than 20 so this is totally legit as a concern.\n","\n","Twenty Twenty, in addition to being pretty near my home, is a local name, so I had no hesitation in choosing them over a chain such as Boots or Specsavers. And I am so glad that I did.\n","\n","Abdel, my optometrist, was just about the nicest guy you could hope to have asking you to read tiny letters from the bottom row. Perky and super-friendly, he was also horrified when I asked if the soft forehead-cushion on the machine was latex (because I'm allergic) and he realised he didn't know. He vowed to find out and was very concerned for me, even when I said that my fringe would do a fine job of protecting me for now. He talked me through absolutely everything the eye test entailed as he did it; he obviously LOVES his job, and even treated my - perfectly routine and boring - answers like I had said something both profound and very correct. That was a lovely feeling for an approval-hungry praise-termite like me and dispelled all my anxiety about whether I was Doing It Right (I get that a lot).\n","\n","Once my prescription was diagnosed, I was passed on to the softly-spoken style guru, Philip, who padded calmly ahead of me and led me to the Wall of Wonder where all the frames were arrayed. This was the bit I was looking forward to. I mentioned my concerns about the roundness of my face and rather than flattering me truthlessly and flogging me the priciest pair regardless, he tactfully agreed and picked out a pair of frames that I loved right away.\n","\n","Understanding my girlish need to try on everything in the shop first, however, he led me along the wall and we chatted about the comparative merits of this or that pair (including a truly awesome pair of purple glittery ones which were so incredibly mental that had they been the right shape I'd have gone with them and to hell with easy accessorising), finishing with a selection of three. He wasn't afraid to tell me if a pair definitely didn't suit me, which was nice, and I didn't feel embarrassed about telling him my budget limit.\n","\n","When there was only one pair I preferred to the first pair I'd tried on, but I was concerned that the arms were too thin and flimsy, he toured the whole shop to try and find a similar but sturdier pair. No joy, but I appreciated it. And so (to Philip's evident professional satisfaction and pride) I went with the first pair he'd picked out for me. Apparently that happens a lot - bravo Philip!\n","\n","A truly splendid experience from start to finish!\n","before Fling your hands up in dramatic horror - until yesterday I had never eaten something prepared or designed by Mr Greenaway! His reputation preceded him of course, and so when I came to Bistro Moderne to check out the Sunday roast with Sharon G, I had high expectations.\n","\n","The location itself is splendid - nestled near St Stephens, it has high ceilings and lots of natural light. We were seated by our enthusiastic waiter in a cosy wood-panelled alcove, which was lovely, although the table was weeny so we had to do some juggling to fit our dishes and glasses on once everything had arrived.\n","\n","Greenaway attends mostly to his main restaurant but comes and cooks in person at the bistro on Sundays, when they offer a roast for two at £25. Starters and desserts are both in the region of £7 so it isn't cheap but as a treat it's just the ticket.\n","\n","Our waiter was thrilled when we ordered the chicken. He was excited to tell us that he had witnessed the preparation of one such chicken earlier and it had entailed a piping bag of butter slid under the skin. Om nom nom. Well, it sure was tender and juicy! Gorgeous chicken, and the roast potatoes were perfection too: crispy, fluffy, not too oily... Dream potatoes. The Yorkshire pudding, which is an explosive puff, was a little too crunchy for my tastes but the brassicas (a mix of chopped sprouts and cabbages) and the carrots (including a couple of purple ones - awesome) were sweet and addictive.\n","\n","For dessert, I chomped on a slice of treacle tart with creme anglaise and a shard of treacle glass. Without wishing to sound too plebeian I think it needed more than just the shallow covering of creme anglaise and a fork would have been helpful to break through the super-chewy top, but it was delicious all the same.\n","\n","One to remember for special occasions!\n","before I'm from a small rural Yorkshire village - I basically lived in an episode of Last of the Summer Wine for twelve years - so believe me when I say I KNOW tea shops. Chintzy, lacy, doily-laden tea shops. Shops where the clinking of translucent china cups and saucers rings like Christmas bells under the chatter of guests and the cold hiss of rain outside.\n","\n","I didn't expect to find this slap bang on one of the busiest streets in the middle of a city.\n","\n","I'll confess that I was mildly biased toward this from the off, simply because Clarinda is one of the names that people tend to come out with when they're flailing around desperately trying to remember what I'm called. But unless there are a lot more Cressidas, Clarissas, Cassandras and Clarabels out there than I thought, and some of them are male and over 60, that same reasoning doesn't explain the long line of people that materialised in hopeful tea-hunting shortly after our party filled the last table. What does explain it, and the fact that the place was already almost packed when we arrived, follows:\n","\n","Mighty fine quiche lorraine, warm and solid, served with crisps and a simple yet effective salad, for the un-wince-worthy sum of £5.50; tea for two, served in a cuddly bulbous teapot blooming with roses (I believe I have mentioned my love of roses in other reviews); dazzlingly swift service; cakes from just £1.75; cheery atmosphere.\n","\n","Explanation served! Alright, so it's a little kitschy, and the laminated menus are a little battered and budget, but if you're down on Canongate and looking for a cosy cuppa and bite, you could do a lot worse than hop through the door and into village-land.\n","before Ooh but it's so DINKY! I've been meaning to try Wellington Coffee out for... oh, a while, so it was with great delight that I accepted an invitation to meet someone for coffee here one morning this week.\n","\n","I rolled up at the allotted time, 8:30, and there was plenty of room to sit (well, proportionately to the amount of seating in general, which isn't a whole bundle because, I repeat, DINKY). And the seat was one of those super-fun stools that has legs but also swivels - a spinning top part that allows you to go \"wheeeeeeee\" if you so desire (and I do so desire).\n","\n","As you know by now, I'm not a coffee person, so I asked rather bashfully for a tea and received No Judgement. This is good. I have fear of asking for tea in a coffee shop. It seems almost as gauche as asking for coffee in a teashop (almost, but not quite). Anyway, judgement was not forthcoming.\n","\n","I also requested an almond croissant. It was fairly big. I began my bold ascent armed with nothing but a knife; some days later, short of breath in the thin air, I reached the summit. Wearily, I sat down at last on the mirror-like slope of a crisped almond flake, looking down at the city, spread out below me like a town in miniature. There was St Giles, there, and over there - the Meadows, dotted with people like tiny seeds. What a beautiful town this is.\n","before For a fairly impromptu mid-price meal in honour of my friend's new flat and job, Tanjore did the trick nicely. The clean and compact interior feels welcoming enough and fuses East and West nicely with elephant embroidery on the ceiling around a classic chandelier.\n","\n","We both boggled at the sheer range on offer within the menu's numerous pages - which include an entire page devoted solely to vegetarian starters - before eventually selecting our meals. She plumped for Chennai fish curry with mint rice, and I decided on Chicken Tanjore with lemon rice.\n","\n","We were both happy with the delicate balance of flavours in our curries, and my friend's mint rice was pretty special too. The sweetness of the parotta was also a great accompaniment to the spicy flavours of the other food.\n","\n","The service, though, was a little laboured and perfunctory from most quarters (we had three different waiters over the course of the evening; a special mention goes out to the young chap who served us last, though, with a smile that lit the room). I was waiting for my friend to arrive for a good ten minutes and was not asked if I wanted a drink. Similarly, nobody checked on us during our meal to see if everything was ok.\n","\n","Our bill came to just under £35, which is really rather good for what we got, but I can't help feeling that the experience would have left a warmer glow in my memory if the staff had been a little more attentive and personable. I wouldn't object to another trip here but it's not somewhere I'd specifically recommend.\n","before Ooh, nice! You know somewhere's ok when they deliver your friend a drink with a clockwork monkey on a string. Chessboard floor, plenty of seating, nice downstairs by the looks of things and an efficient, if taciturn, water.\n","\n","What I really liked was that the instant anyone arrived, the waiter appeared with a weeny tumbler of water to drink while a harder option was decided upon (or not-so-hard, in my case).\n","\n","There's not much in the way of a written menu - just a price list with names and prices, so you'd have to enquire. I think the idea is you pick one - like a lucky dip, hence the name. That's my guess anyway. I requested a mocktail and was asked not what kind of flavour I'd like, which is the usual question, but what I'd like to avoid. Heh. Interesting. No bananas, please, I say, and off he zooms to create something for me.\n","\n","Well, full marks for the not-banana. It definitely didn't have any of that in it. Also no coffee or lamb, so we're on a winner here, folks. All the same, it didn't knocktail my socktails off; it seemed to me more like just bitter lemon with a mint sprig. That said, it was very mature - not that sweet and fruity - and lots of lovely crushed ice to play with afterward. Also, it only cost £3.50. Huzzah!\n","before They absolutely know what they're doing here. The whole place feels warm and wholesome, and the food seems pretty good for you too. In fact, I uploaded a pic to Yelp of one of the counters and intended to caption in \"counter of yumness\" but it autocorrected to \"counter of thinness\"... Realising the counter was laden with fruits and salads, I didn't bother changing it back...\n","\n","I came here for lunch with the lovely Candace B because I'd heard they were pretty good with the whole gluten free thing. I asked what the GF options were on her behalf and was amazed to sit there for no small length of time while our delightful waiter excitably rattled off all the choices. When I came to order my sandwich a little later, he remembered I'd asked and explained with kind concern that the sourdough wasn't GF, whereon I explained that I'd been asking for my companion.\n","\n","The sandwich - chicken with herby mayo - was lovely, although it needed a bit of salt and our salt cellar didn't want to play. That latter bit wasn't really their fault; more likely it was the fault of people who, like me, are too timid to say \"excuse me, this salt cellar is empty\"... The sandwich also came with a gorgeous beet root and spelt salad, which was really filling. I loved it.\n","\n","The staff couldn't have been more cheery and helpful, a real joy, and a great clientele there too, judging by the young man sitting by the door with a Monkey Island game on the chair beside him. \"My cat is called Guybrush, sir,\" I told him, and sailed out the door without another word, feeling awesome and well fed.\n","before I was unprepared for the vastness of Spoon. From the outside, it appears to be little more than a teaspoon, but once you've squeezed through the entrance and trotted up the wooden stairs, you emerge into a veritable serving spoon of a space; light, airy, and dotted with white muslin curtains, Spoon is a spacious joy.\n","\n","Our table of ten, over to one side, included a nice squidgy pew along one of the walls, and nearby was a snuggling of Chesterfield armchairs (yes, that's totally the collective noun) in which I could imagine whiling away hours on end over a hot chocolate and a book. In terms of the place itself, no question, five stars.\n","\n","It's a shame, then, that on this occasion the service was something of a letdown; we waited twenty minutes for our orders to be taken and a further hour for our food to arrive, though it was far from busy, and not a word was said on the delay. And once it had, nobody returned to check on us although I'd have loved another orange juice and was wedged between Yelpy pals on the squidgy pew so getting out was tricky.\n","\n","I'd ordered the muesli and yoghurt. Perhaps I was imagining something a little more constructed, but what arrived was precisely that - a vast bowl of muesli with a slightly carelessly-shaped flurp of yoghurt across the top. It was very yummy, but the muesli to yoghurt ratio was large; more a case of too much muesli than too little yoghurt, and I ended up taking Jenna L's unused milk jug from her tea to moisten the remaining melee.\n","\n","A trip to the toilets was a fun treat, though, decorated as they are with cuttings from old beauty magazines, all of them the print version of \"keep young and beautiful if you want to be loved\", which is highly entertaining reading while one carries out ones functions.\n","\n","In short, I adored Spoon and really want to give it a better rating. I'm not sure what was up - at one point we were laughing because every single member of staff appeared to have vanished - but I fully intend to return here and give it another go. It HAS to be as good as it could be.\n","\n","I'm not usually apologetic over a three star review, because it's a good rating - \"A-OK\" is fine by me - but would break my heart if \"A-OK\" were truly representative of somewhere that ought to be such a delight.\n","before Commander Riker said, \"Blondes and jazz seldom go together.\" I'm not sure how fair that is to blondes, but until Harajuku Kitchen I'd have said it was a good generalisation with regard to green tea.\n","\n","Somehow, it works. Harajuku Kitchen is a beautiful and ungimmicked Japanese restaurant more interested in a good dining experience than being a food theme park. In a delightful pale pink bomb of East Meets West, it fuses soft candlelight, gentle jazz, wooden flooring and chopsticks to create a relaxing and extremely enjoyable mealtime. Harajuku is the area of Tokyo best known for its funky street style subcultures such as Lolita, but the eponymous Kitchen is far more subtle in its decor.\n","\n","Kaori is a wonderfully cheerful hostess, seemingly thrilled with her establishment (rightly). The first time I came I was able to work by the window using the free wifi (mega Cressi bonus points) as the tea came in abundance. More recently, I came here with Moray L for lunch on a torrentially rainy day. Inside, it was peaceful and oh so warm. We could feel cosy, forgetting the world outside.\n","\n","Oh and the food! It's all very well having a beautiful and comfortable little place (little is the word!) but if the food don't cut the mustard then kind words won't butter no parsnips and... I'm mixing my analogies... In a foodie confusion caused by the joy of this meal. My tonkatsu was amazing - a goodly portion of delicious, tender pork and flavoursome rice of just the right stickiness to handle easily with chopsticks. The value is very good too; most dishes are under a tenner and if they're all as good as mine (Moray's chicken was to die for too) then you really can't go wrong.\n","\n","I'm just glad I don't live in Bruntsfield or I would never have any money. I think every meal would end up being bought from HK. Oh yes. Did I mention they do takeaway?\n","before Does it sound weird to say Waverley never quite seems finished? I don't just mean the apparently perpetual work to add escalators or refurbish the concourses. I mean from the outside too. It looks like an urban polytunnel, as though one day they will pull back the covers and reveal a beautiful ripe railway station, running over with iron rail juice trails.\n","\n","Nuh-uh. I love Waverley as the herald of homecoming, my arrival point at the most beautiful city in the world. I do not love Waverley for its dodgy platform signage, roads within the station, bizarre navigation routes between platforms, and general sense of grime.\n","\n","On the plus side, it's got an M\u0026S Simply Food, a good-sized WH Smith, Upper Crust, Boots (for those forgotten toothbrushes and last-minute cosmetic touchups), Caffe Nero, WhistleStop, Burger King, pasty stand, Millie's Cookies and even a bureau de change, so there's plenty to do while you're finding your way around. It also adjoins Princes Mall in case you arrived fiendishly early for your train and need some shoes. But the layout can cause frustration even beyond the palliative powers of a shortcrust pasty.\n","before WHAT?! I thought... I thought this place was tiny! I... I have to dress up as Thorin now and hug Robyn Z while saying emotionally: \"Never have I been so wrong.\" Memetastic.\n","\n","Basically, behind the cute'n'kooky cafe out front displaying its deeeelicious looking cakes, there is this enormous and beautiful room with elaborate wallpaper, an upright piano, cool art on the walls, candles, lots and lots of tables and space... woah. I had no idea.\n","\n","When we arrived, we were offered a couple of options for places to sit, and we (predictably, on such a freezing cold night) elected to sit next to the radiator. The only slight issue with this was that I had my back to the upright piano, which has a little lip on the lid. I have this big, big laugh that is basically a \"HAAA!\" with my head thrown back, and on one occasion this resulted in my almost needing stitches, but I think I managed to stop the bleeding... ok, exaggeration. I bumped my head on the corner and said \"ow\" quietly, is all that happened.\n","\n","Anyway, the food, folks. I wasn't too sold on the bread that came while we awaited our mains - the wholemeal seemed a little bitter and dry. However, when the main event arrived... well, I can't remember the last time the very first mouthful of something made my eyes widen, my heart leap and my voice go \"OH!\". I'd ordered the guinea fowl with curly kale and sauteed new potatoes, and that kale and those potatoes were the first thing I tried. And OH MY. Flavour explosion. Amazing! The guinea fowl was tender and perfectly cooked. At first, when the plate arrived, I thought there wasn't much on it, but it was the perfect amount. I had a couple of Robyn's fries that came with her steak, too, and oh my. Light, crispy, beautifully seasoned... perfection.\n","\n","Dessert was where the real difficulty lay because the selection was fairly astounding. We informed the waiter of our indecision and he was so helpful with his recommendations. \"The sticky toffee pudding is the most popular, but in my opinion, is nothing special. The carrot cake is very good, and the fruit and frangipane tart.\" Right you are, sir! Carrot cake for Robyn Z, F\u0026F tart for me, and, of course, we partook of one another's desserts... in the name of, er, reviewing completionism. My tart was warm, which I hadn't expected, and served with mascarpone. It was utterly delicious, although \"fruit\" seemed a little vague and I'm not convinced there was much involved beyond apple. I could be wrong, but that's how it seemed. Robyn's carrot cake was monumentally huge and really nice, although I'm not sure it necessarily would stand for me in an identity lineup of carrot cakes. Oh, but to be in a situation where I had to taste an identity lineup of cakes... now I'm in a dream world...\n","before With a little imagination, some plywood walls and ramps in the dark can easily become an abandoned and dilapidated spaceship, where your mission is to destroy enemies on sight with your pew-pew laser gun.\n","\n","I think the marvellous thing about Laserquest is how it's completely impossible to be cool and grown-up about it. It is among the silliest and most frenetic of group activities and after a few minutes of zooming around stealthily in the dark, the crestfallen howling of the stricken and the victorious ululations of their attacker become the sporadic soundtrack to A HUGE AMOUNT OF FUN.\n","\n","This particular Laserquest is especially sublime. Some of the walls have small holes in them, permitting the more cautious and patient to take up advantageous positions and watch\\/shoot from the relative safety of a blind corner. (The issue with that is when you get backed helplessly into your previously unassailable dead end by Rachel R with a triumphant gleam in her eyes and a merciless twitch in her trigger finger).\n","\n","There were six of us present for this CMYE and it was pretty much the ideal number. I'd say you could go up to eight without messing up the dynamic too much, although there's room for up to 20 players. You'd just end up shooting people non-stop though! The fun with a smaller group is the occasional periods of silence as everyone breaks away from the melee to stalk a vulnerable outlier...\n","\n","Once you've entered your name, that's what the staff will call you without hesitation or irony. It's apparent that they are well aware how much of the experience is the giddiness that comes with choosing a super-awesome space name. (I accidentally named myself after an insane bad guy, but I swear it was an accident.)\n","\n","The guns are less infuriating than the other laser game place I've been to, where if you didn't hold them with two hands then they wouldn't work. That made shooting blind around corners pretty tricky.\n","\n","I want to go agaaaaaaaaaaaaaain.\n","\n","Oh. And don't wear a white t-shirt. You will die.\n","before My brother (now legendary in my reviews, I feel) bought me a pair of second hand boots for Christmas 2012, and they are without question the best, most well-made, most comfortable and durable items of footwear I have ever had the pleasure of sliding my tootsies into. I wear them everywhere. This winter, when the stitching began to rot, I even painstakingly sewed them back up, myself. But re-heeling is beyond my ken.\n","\n","I'm a tall lass of 5'11\", and naturally contrary and therefore inclined to wear heels, so a good place for shoe repair is essential in my neighbourhood. This branch of Timpson fits the bill, thank you. I took in three pairs of boots for re-heeling, including the beloved Boots of Bro and a pair with perished soles that needed a complete new sole. When I handed them over, I mentioned my mending job and the man actually took the time to examine and admire my work, which was really sweet of him. I was quoted upfront for the three pairs: just shy of £9 for each of the two pairs that just needed re-heeling, and £18.95 for the pair that needed re-soling, with re-heeling included in that. I thought that was pretty reasonable since a whole new sole on leather cowgirl boots can't be a small job. I was even asked whether I'd like to pay there and then or on collection - really nice to have the choice.\n","\n","But when I returned, I was in for a surprise. \"One of your pairs, the whole heel was falling off,\" the man told me. I felt my stomach sink. \"We replaced it; there's no point just re-heeling if it's falling off anyway.\" Gosh, what a job. That can't have been cheap... But no! I was still charged only the price I was initially quoted! Amazing!\n","\n","This funny little branch is more like a kiosk, just a counter in a wall in the shopping centre. The staff are cheerful and friendly and really seem to care; this gentleman was able, for example, to recognise me and tell me about my boots' heel without referring to any notes. And they got the whole lot done in less than 24 hours. I am happy and impressed, and all my lovely boots are good as new.\n","before Twice. Twice in one weekend. Twice was I able to taste this majestic glory - the greatest rice pudding ever known on this little planet. Through the dark and cold of a winter's evening, amid the grim determination of throngs of Christmas shoppers, there shone a warm light from the market on Castle Street... the light of hope. The light of rice.\n","\n","On my first visit, I was presented with a tray laden with shot-glass-sized free samples of tiramisu-flavoured rice pudding. I declined, explaining that I'm not a fan of tiramisu (I know, I know). I was immediately offered my choice of sample and, requesting the vanilla, was thrilled to have a little sample served up specially. \n","\n","Ohh...\n","\n","I don't think I can effectively convey the joy that this rice pudding brought to my heart, soul and stomach. Straight away, I was whipping my wallet out for a full portion. There was choice - tiramisu flavour, vanilla flavour, chocolate flavour, and sticky toffee flavour. There were toppings - apricots, chocolate chips, crumbled Oreos, strawberry coulis and more. There was size - a cardboard tub the size of my palm filled nearly to the brim with steaming sweet goodness, to be eaten with a plastic spoon whose headlong puddingward diving destiny I truly envied. All this for just £3.50.\n","\n","On visit number one, I had the vanilla with strawberry coulis topping. Classic bliss, and the vanilla just sweet and present enough for the pudding not to be called \"plain\". On visit number two, I opted for toffee, holding the toppings so as to allow the flavour to work its magic all alone. I honestly can't decide which I preferred. Both are memories I shall treasure.\n","\n","My second visit was meant to be to try the bubble tea, but it was the stall's last day at the market. Having fallen so hard for the pudding, I couldn't bear the thought of perhaps never sampling it again, so I ended up having portion number two instead of the bubble tea which had so excited many Yelpers. Nevertheless, I live in fervent hope that the Rice Bubble will once more take up residence in Edinburgh before very long and I will get the opportunity to do so. And to eat more pudding. Please, Santa, I have been ever so ever so good this year. Bring me back that Bubble.\n","before Ohhhhh, that's it. That, my friends, is IT. I am updating. This place has to get the fifth star.I came here for lunch today with Nikki A and it garnered Major Bonus Points in a number of ways additional to those excellent features mentioned in my last review.\n","\n","Nikki was able to bring her gorgeous wee four-legged pal along because (Major Bonus Points number one) it is dog-friendly. I ordered the lemon chicken wrap, which was (MPB#2) GIGANTIC. It came wrapped in flatbread, rather than a tortilla, so it was pretty (MBP#3) hefty, and (MBP#4) the filling was super-generous. And, more to the point, (MBP#5) extremely good. No doubt with regard to the lemony flavour, and the chicken delicate and tender... Word of Mouth, could you be any more wonderful? Methinks not. Five stars for you, my love.\n","before Southern Cross is the first place I think of for a quickish lunch with a friend before they have to catch the train. Just a little less than halfway down Cockburn Street, which winds colourfully toward the Market Street entrance to the station, it's ideally located and, inside, bigger than it looks.\n","\n","I've been here a couple of times; on this most recent visit, I opted for the smoked salmon toast with cream cheese. It was really good, but - and I can't believe this is actually a criticism! - too much salmon. I are well over three quarters of it but by the time the toast and cheese were all gone, it began to be a little sickly just downing the salmon.\n","\n","They have lots of cakes and things which (amazingly) I've not tried yet, but they look good. Be aware that they also will not split a bill for you. That seems totally weird to me; I understand it during the high visitor volumes of August since it can slow proceedings but on a regular day I don't see why they'd simply refuse...\n","\n","Service is also variable. The first time I came, I had a delightfully charming young man who admired my brooch. This most recent time, the young lady was civil, but slightly curt. Nonetheless, the three of us got fed amply and had a drink each, and the bill came to £26, which really isn't bad in the Mile area.\n","before I'm having a noodle love affair! Everyone I've brought here has fallen for Red-Box, just as I did, and comes back time and again. Even friends from out of town have clamoured for a trip to Red-Box at some point during their visit, and I'm pretty sure that's not simply to escape my notorious cooking. The variety of items on offer means that there's something for everyone, and you can either develop your own personal favourite or experiment with something new every trip, knowing it's going to be freshly cooked right from scratch there and then.\n","\n","The concept behind Red-Box is simple but effective; along the lines of a Subway for noodles, customers pick their base (noodle type), key filling (meat) and extras (vegetables, sauce, and seasoning). Large signs near the entrance explain the process and different noodle types to beginners, and then you just head straight on in and compile your dream meal.\n","\n","Brilliantly located and never less than delicious food, this is a regular lunch-spot for me. The titular red box arrives at lightning speed just minutes after ordering (everything moves fast in this place, including the queue) and, TARDIS-like, contains piles more nosh than a conventional understanding of spatial dimensions ought to permit.\n","\n","For those patrons choosing not to take away, the restaurant is clean and functional, although not particularly stylish in its minimalism and the stools can get little uncomfortable. The service is as one would might hope for from a fast-food restaurant - brisk but polite - and the pricing with noodle boxes starting from little over £5 is extremely good value given the sheer quantity within. A drink can boost the price considerably, though; while you'd be hard pushed even when buying a starter and beer to spend as much as £10, the comparative added expense of drinks does mean that Red-Box can be a less competitive option for a full meal than some other fast-food outlets, based on price alone. Of course, if you're taking away and have your own drinks sorted, then I can't see a single reason you'd go anywhere other than Red-Box to get your food.\n","\n","Noodle me. Noodle me good, Red-Box, my love.\n","before I realised, after my last review, that I've still never reviewed the Elephant House. I'm not sure how as I bring most people here when they're visiting me.\n","\n","\"Do you really?\" I can hear you thinking. \"But you've given it three stars!\" Well, yes. As a cafe, it's not so hot. It's kind of expensive, although it's a lovely space. The service is as quick as it can be, given that it's almost always heaving in here with tourists wondering which table J K Rowling used to sit at. The cakes are fine. The hot chocolate is fine. It's just a nice place.\n","\n","It's funny, but when you're inside you wouldn't necessarily know this was \"the place\". The theme is, fittingly, elephants. There are elephants everywhere. It's quite sweet. People don't come for the elephants, though. They come for the magic.\n","\n","The Elephant House, you see, touts itself as The Birthplace Of Harry Potter. Everyone knows the tale - that Jo Rowling, a penniless single mother, used to spend hours in an Edinburgh cafe, writing the book about a boy wizard that would, once published, lift her almost overnight to international literary superstardom. Well, the Elephant House, like many other establishments in Edinburgh, claims to be that cafe. Unlike many other establishments, however, here people have bought into the story. The tourists are fully invested in it. You can see how, gazing out of the large window at the back directly onto the majestic crags of the castle, someone might conceive the notion of Hogwarts.\n","On the website, there's even an interview with the writer from shortly before the publication of the second book, filmed at the cafe (which incidentally is worth a watch because it's endearing how thrilled she is with sales that now pale in comparison to current figures). \n","\n","Now, I don't want to get into a discussion on the nature of truth; this is a cafe review. BUT - whether or not it's true that she actually wrote there is, I think, not important. What's important is that everyone believes it. It's got a kind of truth of its own. Which leads me on to why I bring everyone here for a quick cup of tea, despite the big crowds, the big prices, the fact that while the food is pleasant there are many other places doing much nicer stuff nearby...\n","\n","The toilets. You have to go into the toilets.\n","\n","Obviously, I don't know what the men's loo is like, but if it's like the ladies', then it's a strangely uplifting experience. The walls are covered in graffiti: scribbled letters of gratitude, love and affection to the writer who changed the world and to the characters who are so real to so many. There are silly references, in-jokes about in-jokes, sketchy doodles and deeply heartfelt missives of appreciation, and never has finding words of love written on the wall of a public toilet been so innocent and so beautiful. Hogwarts might be fictional, but the magic here is real.\n","before No, but you don't understand, it isn't LIKE that, guys. It isn't snooty. It isn't scene. In fact, if you didn't know that everything here was good and virtuous, that whatever your dietary requirements you are probably guaranteed to find it catered for, you wouldn't realise that that was the whole point. Sure, there's gluten free stuff, vegan stuff, dairy free stuff, juice cleanses, organic boosters, aaaaaaall that jazz.\n","\n","But it doesn't feel preachy or superior - it's just... really nice. Wooden tables, big front window in a leafy street in Marchmont just beside the Meadows, lots of light and space, and a mighty fine looking lemon tart I want to go back and try. Yep, it's a winner. Maybe they could do with a couple more comfy places to sit, perhaps, as one of my lasting memories is of \"quite hard\".\n","\n","However, my carrot, orange and celery juice was a super-refreshing start to a day that would later contain, from another establishment, two coffees in a row and the world's largest slice of red velvet cake, and yet I felt healthy all day because of the juice. Maybe that's the only danger here: the ability to fool yourself your diet is JUST FINE because you feel so good from just the smallest Meadowlarking of a morning.\n","before *stands* My name is Cressida, and I am a stationery-aholic.\n","\n","I don't know when the problem started. I think it might have been when I was given some personalised crayons in a Winnie-the-Pooh pencil case on my parents' anniversary when I was four. (I still have the pencil case, y'all.) All I know is that it's a deep, dark, undeniable part of me. Pens. All the pens. Gel pens, fineliners, permanent markers, dry-wipes, biros, cartridge pens, fountain pens - heck, I even stuck a calligraphy nib in a feather I found once. And pencils. Notebooks. Diaries. As I've grown, it's even extended to office furniture and desk layouts. And not always the \"pretty stationery\" type. I like the really functional stuff too.\n","\n","Anyway, this is going somewhere. Where this is going is that I really like Ryman. This branch, in particular, is something of a joy. The staff are a delight and I'm pretty sure that's not just because they now recognise me. And once, when I went in just before closing, I heard one of the girls working there say to a colleague, \"It's that time of day when the wanderers come in.\"\n","\n","\"I'm a wanderer,\" I answered. \"But I'm wandering in search of clipboards. Have you any...?\"\n","\n","She pointed me to the correct shelf immediately, and I think perhaps some bats down in Leith might have heard me when I spotted the teeniest, tiniest clipboard of all time. I snatched it up and, hugging it close to my chest, trotted gleefully to the counter, where the gentleman service was the same one as usual.\n","\n","\"Hullo,\" he said. \"Just that for you, today?\"\n","\"YOU SHOULD HAVE HEARD THE NOISE SHE MADE WHEN SHE SAW IT!\" called the girl from the other end of the shop.\n","\n","It's that kind of place, you know?\n","before The Queen's Hall is the venue that makes me proudest of Edinburgh. It's just so totally in love with live music - \"We *heart* it live\" is even written above the door - in a way that so many venues around the country don't seem to be, regardless of their programming. The Queen's Hall just exudes passion for music of all genres and it's a venue that loves to share its enthusiasm. They're hot on the social media too, sharing music from forthcoming events, video clips from past concerts, and just generally stuff that makes them happy.\n","\n","The bar area is spacious so it doesn't feel cramped or crowded before the show. The loose-chair seating in the stalls means that a range of different setups are possible to suit the occasion, from straight rows to cabaret tables. And finally, the floor is made of wonderful stone flags, the stage is low, and the whole space feels remarkably intimate despite the venue's solid capacity of 900.\n","\n","Pretty much every time a musician I love and admire comes to Edinburgh, I know before I even have to check the listings that they'll be performing at the Queen's Hall. If the treatment they get is anything like what the audience gets from the front of house, bar and box office staff, then it must be one of the most enjoyable dates on the tour.\n","\n","Everything combined makes me genuinely emotional at the thought of the Queen's Hall. I feel like I'm getting a big warm musical hug every time I so much as walk past. Oh, I love you, Queen's Hall. I love you dearly. Stay forever.\n","before Oh, La Fav, La Fav, we are breaking up, and by the looks of things it's definitely not you, it's me.\n","\n","I just - I just - I'm sorry. I don't get it. I'd love to give this an extra star just for the timely delivery and the polenta chips, which are great, but really, it wouldn't be representative: I have not found the experience as a whole A-OK. My three starses are chirpy. But I am currently sad and doleful. And it looks like this will be the very first two star review, so anybody reading this, please just assume I'm wrong, because I am so in the minority and I want La Fav to do well.\n","\n","But anyway, I'm writing because it is my habit to do so. Here goes.\n","\n","I heard such amazing things about La Fav's pizzas. They're the best in Edinburgh! They're astonishing! They're... really not... for me. \n","\n","And to say that I'd sooner pay the extra couple of quid and get a pizza from a national chain is really upsetting for me, because I'd love to prefer somewhere local and non-chainy and freshly made and all that jazz.\n","\n","And I tried. Really. I was super unimpressed with the first pizza I had delivered, which was a calzone. When it arrived, sure, it was big, but it was also completely wet and falling apart. It bled juice everywhere, was not all that warm, and was just - well, if *I* don't enjoy a pizza, something is wrong.\n","\n","Anyway, I figured that that something that was wrong must be me, because the reviews continued to pour in. Hooray for La Fav! We love La Fav! Their pizzas rule pizzaland! So I tried again, a couple of months later. And, well, this one was not bad. It also wasn't all that good. I just felt it lacked flavour. It was - I can't believe I'm saying this about a pizza - boring. Not boring like simple-and-predictable-but-yummy-nonetheless. Just... eh. I paid all that for this? Here's the kicker. I. Didn't. Finish. It. A pizza. Me. ...Tears.\n","\n","So there's my saga of twin woes. My chronicles of double disappointment. My tale of two pities. Have a great life, La Favorita. I wish you all the best. You will find someone who appreciates you for what you are.\n","before Having just moved into an unfurnished flat, naturally my first stop for fitting it out with the necessary furniture on a tight budget was the Mystical Realm Of Flatpack. You know what you're getting with IKEA, and (assuming what you want is in stock) you get the same at every branch. So what's so good about this particular branch?\n","\n","Well, for starters, it's on two levels. Other branches of IKEA that I've been to have all been on one floor, which is fine and dandy until you reach the \"Marketplace\" (that's the bit where you can actually put stuff in your trolley instead of just writing down the name and number of things too big to carry) and suddenly you get totally lost. You walk through an interdimensional gap in the chopping boards and find yourself way back in Sleeping Solutions with no way to reunite with your companion ever again, like a Rose Tyler of futons.\n","\n","Not so in this natty two-storey arrangement. That two-phase approach to the IKEA experience is neatly divided by a set of stairs.\n","\n","The staff are also rather pleasant. The lady who scanned my multitude of pallets wished me \"happy building\" and the chappy who served me my hot dog (you gotta have a hot dog; it's the law) was almost skipping around the counter. Strange but true.\n","\n","Everything that I wanted, with the exception of a mirror that I really shouldn't have been thinking of buying anyway, was in stock. Lucky me, or efficient them, or both. (Clearly if breaking a mirror is bad luck, intending to buy one that you don't even need is very good luck.) And I sailed away with a song in my heart and a desk in my van, and a merry afternoon was thereafter had sorting out screws and cams and what-the-heck-is-this-things and generally converting two dimensions into three.\n","before Oh my yummity yum. Caffe Lucano, your milkshake brings Cressida to the yard. Lemony milkshake deliciousness that was so thick I could not resist blowing down my straw to see how long the bubbles would take to surface. Yes indeedy. I shall be returning for more of this.\n","\n","I shall also be returning to try pretty much every single thing on the menu, since it took me the length of the Cretaceous period to decide on risotto calabrese because everything looked so good. And judging by the standard of my risotto calabrese (and of my friend's extraordinary risotto with rabbit ragout), I won't be disappointed.\n","\n","From the outside, this looks just kind a standard cafe - a bit clinical and basic, with the usual sneeze-guard counter of pleasant looking cakes and a list of hot drinks. But we fell in here sort of on a whim and found a menu of wonders (luckily we didn't see the entire blackboard-wall of specials or we would never have reached a decision).\n","\n","So why only three stars? Well, when we arrived, the waiter lad had his head stuck in a cupboard, blocking our entry, and took a long time to move. He was pretty dilatory with all the service and didn't ever actually check up on us or offer to bring us more drinks. He just sort of shuffled around in his trainers and jeans. We were in there for more than two hours, so you'd think he'd have at least said something, but each time we needed something we just had to kind of wave.\n","\n","But whatever. The food was yumtastic and oh, the milkshake. And they have a nice range of hot chocolates too. And the ice cream sundaes sounded awesome, if a little pricey. So, like I said, I'll be back, and I look forward to it.\n","before When Moray L and I fancied one of our dinner and catchup evenings near to her work, Field sprang to mind as a place I'd been meaning to try for ages. And with a dinner earlybird \"pre-theatre\" for £14.95 it was hard to find a reason not to!\n","\n","I was excited, given the swathes of five-star reviews it's been garnering, but also tentative. I needn't have been, because wowee, what a place!\n","\n","My starter, sauteed wild mushrooms on toasted brioche, was paradise. I want to eat it every day for the rest of my life. There was nothing, nothing, nothing not to love about it, except that it was over when I had eaten it all. That made me sad.\n","\n","But not for long, because steering towards me at a goodly rate of knots was a glee dream of a sea bream. I deliberately avoided the chicken offered on the menu because I ALWAYS have chicken, so I took a risk on a fishy I'd never had before and boy, am I glad I did. Crispy skin, melt-in-the-mouth flesh, and the peas with bacon were an incredibly rich and delicious addition. In fact, if anything, with the chips involved as well there was almost too much here and I was struggling toward the end, with a shivering fear that pudding might elude me.\n","\n","Pudding, I say with such relieved gratitude that you may picture me falling to my knees, did not elude me. Pudding enchanted me. Pudding was a cherry mouse with chocolate sorbet, not too sweet but seriously sophisticated and just... ugh, too good.\n","\n","Another lovely touch in this adorably dinky little restaurant is the constant top-ups of cucumber water. I'm also a big fan of the giant bull painting on the wall - thematic, but quirky.\n","\n","Yep, this is a helluva place. It is very likely to become my standard go-to before a night at the Festival Theatre. Thank you, lovely Field!\n","before This ought to be a five-star review.\n","\n","Had it not been for a few minor aggravations, it would have been.\n","\n","Let's get those out of the way first: the card machine was broken - not their fault I know, but running up the road in the rain to the nearest cashpoint does sully one's experience a little. There was no sugar on the table to put in my tea, meaning it had to be pilfered from another table. FInally, the girl serving didn't ask me if I wanted ketchup on my bacon roll, leaving me to assume it would be delivered on the side anyway, which it wasn't...\n","\n","But those are minor aggravations. Mini mini mini qualms. Overall, PJ is quite simply L.O.V.E.L.Y. Big and fresh and high-ceilinged, with a good line in yummy-looking cakes (including some simply adorable mini macarons) and a fine Chesterfield sofa, this is my kinda place for real. I don't get out to this end of town all that much but this is definitely a beacon to draw me back. (Although it looks like they're opening a branch on South Bridge, so, y'know. It depends where the sofa ends up. I'm fickle.)\n","\n","My bacon sandwich came on proper wholemeal bread, just like you'd hope, in a roll bigger than my palm. Ok, ok, tiny mandolin hands render that comparison useless. Let's say about the size of a saucer. A happy size. A truly filling size. Sure, without the ketchup it was a little drier than ideal but not so much that I bothered to actually ASK for ketchup. Add to that that my pot of tea was good and generous and cost me less than two quid, and I was properly set for a darn tootin' good day.\n","\n","Thanks, Pat Jacob. Looking forward to having you in Old Town!\n","before It's slap bang on the Royal Mile, so this must be one of the busiest Starbucks branches in the world in August, but somehow they keep on serving efficiently and effectively. It's normally pretty busy in the morning too - coffee rush hour, unsurprisingly - but their morning supervisor is a delight. He welcomes every single new queue member through the door with a smile, takes names and orders on arrival and lines up the neatly labelled cups for the baristas to fill assiduously in sequence. There have been times when I've felt like I really must be the highlight of his day, only to see him greet those who arrive behind me with equal geniality. That's service with a smile, folks.\n","\n","You know what Starbucks serves and what it costs. Well, this is a Starbucks, so it's got all that. What this branch in particular has to recommend it is a very fine people-watching vantage point. Most of the seating is upstairs (the downstairs is little bigger than the queue and serving area) in what feels like an old library. From a seat by the plentiful windows there, you can see Hunter Square, most of the way down Cockburn Street and a good portion of the Mile itself.\n","\n","If, like me, you like to sit with a hot choc and watch the world go by, there aren't many finer spots to do it, especially if you like the people you watch to be buzzing around along beautiful uneven streets cobbled with history.\n","\n","They've got to know me by name in there now I think; although they know me as Mary. Spelling out my unconventional name just holds up the queue...\n","before I'm not an outdoorsy type by any stretch of the imagination (and my imagination is particularly stretchy) so it's rare for me to find myself in a place like this, but I followed my friend in as she hunted for a new waterproof for her climbing exploits.\n","\n","At first we were a bit disappointed by the apparently small shop and there wasn't much besides coats at all (although not, that we could see, the kind she sought). Then we realised there was another floor, and when we ascended the stairs - oh my! An emporium of gargantuan proportions stocking just about everything I could think would ever be useful.\n","\n","We made a beeline for the rest of the coats and were fairly promptly approached by one of the staff, who asked if she could help us. My friend, who had a very specific idea of what she wanted, tried to explain what she was looking for, but didn't seem to be able to communicate the idea too clearly. I being a not-expert in terminology was unable to assist! The girl was very helpful, though, and really knew her stuff. I stood by and let them exchange terminology and brand names for a bit.\n","\n","Trying to figure out what the item being described was, she mentioned two things that we had missed downstairs, but said that one was definitely too large for my friend and the only one in stock, while the others were more expensive than my friend's budget allowed.\n","\n","When we went back downstairs and browsed again, she was absolutely right - the two items we'd missed on our first scout around were almost perfect except one being the wrong size and the other being a bit pricey! So we didn't find what we'd gone in for, but there was a wide selection of brands and items available (beyond the oh-so-trendy The North Face) and the assistant was very knowledgeable, trying very hard to help.\n","before Ok, so, as promised, here is an update... and it's still four stars.\n","\n","I wonder if it's because I have this unnerving habit of actually going into the office in person when I have a question, but EPM have been nothing short of angelic to me. Back in December, when we had that maaaad weather in December when the rain was kinda blowing UPWARDS under the eves, I emailed them two days before Christmas to say a couple of drips were coming through the ceiling. That's all it was, a few drips, but I was sad that when I got back from Christmas they hadn't got back to me. I'm cutting them some slack because they'd probably left for the holidays when my email came through and things get lost. If I'd been really bothered I'd have phoned, but there was no damage done.\n","\n","Now then, a couple of weeks ago, my washing machine broke down. I did my usual trick of walking into the office to mention it and at the same time I explained about my email that had gone astray. They were supremely apologetic. In two days, an engineer was round to fix my machine, and today I had a call checking to see that he'd been, and asking if anyone had sorted my ceiling yet too. I said yes to the former, no to the latter, and they promised to get onto it.\n","\n","I never expected unprompted communication from them on any matter not relating to finance. I'm impressed! This is the key, folks. Don't email, don't phone. Walk in. That's kind of my approach to stuff anyway but that's my tip to you.\n","before What a very pleasant little hideaway! It glows warmly out of the old shadows in the night with an inviting wink. Inside, it's spacious but intimate, and the decoration is fantastic - halfway between classy cocktail joint and Southern diner, which is kind of what it is, really.\n","\n","For a cocktail night, though... It isn't for water buffaloes like me. Given that some of the \"Sygnature\" (iswydt) cocktails are a fiver, the £5.50 blanket cost for a mocky is a bit of a sting.\n","\n","Presentation is key here, and most of the drinks come excitingly presented - I made a bad call starting with the apple and raspberry cooler because it was pretty much just a standard tumbler, which I soon learned was unusual. The drink itself was nice and refreshing, but visually not a patch on the monstrosity that arrived when I ordered the Um Bongo. A hefty earthenware tiki jug appeared before me with a leaf of aloe (I think) flourishing on the rim. Whee, such fun to look at! I wanted to put on my grass skirt and hula till the sun sank into the blood red ocean...\n","\n","But seriously. I think I just paid £5.50 for a can of Lilt...  I mean, I love Lilt, it's my favourite drink, but you can't just pour it into a (admittedly awesome) tiki jug and call it a mocktail. I think.\n","\n","Ok, being fair, the menu states that there's pineapple juice and bitters going on there, \"topped off with\" the Lilt, but if I'd been guessing, I'd have said it was the sole ingredient. It was fun, but I felt a bit disappointed - even more so since if actually asked for a non-alcoholic version of the Nutella milkshake only to be told they had no Nutella, so it was actually a second choice.\n","\n","If I were rating on drinks alone, this'd be a definite two, but the place is so lovely and the food looked so good that it's a solid three, and it might even push to a four when I go back try that delicious looking food for myself. I'll just make sure I stick to drinking only water...\n","before To beard - verb: to boldly confront or challenge. But while it's bold, there's nothing confrontational about this new barber-themed bar. It's cosy but not poky, light but not glaring, and there's so much space that will easily fit the many people who no doubt will begin to flock here as word spreads.\n","\n","And what fun! The candles on the tables nestle in old hair wax tins. The bill is delivered in a Fisherman's Friend tin. The walls are home to old framed adverts for hair treatments in that excitably verbose writing style found only in old adverts... and occasionally my reviews. Some of the chairs are even barbers' chairs; add to this the majestically styled facial hair of the gentlemen behind the bar and you have a mighty fine theme going on. All of the staff were also wearing very nice bow-ties and were extremely perky. How can one not be perky, when one is finely coiffed and attired in a nice bow-tie?\n","\n","Now here's something extra exciting: I ordered water. The guy basically juggled my glass around anyway as though he was making a cocktail! Scoop! Sloosh! Ice with a flourish. Plop! Lemon slice with aplomb. This is the happiest water I've ever had.\n","\n","Edinburgh has been famous for its pandas for a while now - here's one more to bring the crowds.\n","before Um, so... I don't actually like Chinese food. Not, like, I absolutely won't eat it - I'd just never choose it myself. I came here for Paddy H's birthday and so, I should preface this review with that, and state that my twenty-ish quid for the unlimited banquet would have been better value if I'd actually dug into everything properly instead of tentatively nibbling and then just waiting for more chicken dumplings to arrive. It's already not cheap as meals go, even all-you-can-eat ones.\n","\n","However, my rating is based entirely on the experience as a whole and not my own personal foodie preference (because that would be just daft). Besides, I was informed by the gentleman on my left, who had spent no small amount of time living in China, that what we were indulging in was in fact extremely good, albeit the geographic and cultural equivalent of serving linguine, sangria, falafel and bratwurst on the same table.\n","\n","I believe I've mentioned my tapas hesitancy before - how I cling desperately to my favourite thing and guard it, snarling, from others' hands. This is also a large part of my problem with Chinese meals. This is not, however, a problem with the Chop Chop banquet - you can simply ask for more! MORE! MOAAAAAAAR!\n","\n","Simultaneously the good and bad side to this is that everything is made fresh to order, so if you don't ask well before you've finished what's already on the table, you're left sitting for a goodly while before more sails toward you. And, in the case of my beloved chicken dumplings, you might have to ask a couple of times. Given the size of the place and the number of replenishing orders they must take from people, it's unsurprising and somewhat forgiveable that the occasional order goes astray.\n","\n","The staff were efficient, if not overly friendly, and attended our table frequently. The real highlight for me, though, was the glittery tables. Just like Christmas in my mum's kitchen! Red glitter everywhere, yay!\n","\n","So - it's just fine, and on nights of better service this is a definite four-star place, but my own experience on this occasion, with some hyper-extended waits combined with a fairly high meal price, registers at a positive three.\n","before I was confused. I couldn't work out where the museum was. It must have been there somewhere. Light, spacious and glass-fronted, with stand-alone bookshelves, tallboy tables, free Wifi and sofas in the corner, Loudons was perhaps a little too comfortable for a museum cafe, but surely the lost treasures of ancient Babylon were in another building just around the corner somewhere, for what else would cause a beautiful place such as this to charge an eye-watering £6.45 for a pot of rooibos tea and a slice of cheesecake? Cheesecake, I might add, which I had to plate up for myself.\n","\n","But at Loudons, you pay for the experience. You pay for the space, the light, the ample seating. You pay for the large range of choice in cakes and yummery. You pay for the gloriously cheerful staff, who will take time out of their busy day to discuss the still-expanding Knitted Thing draped amply across your industrious companion's lap and pooling in lichen-like waves on the floor. You pay for the cheesecake so dense and flavoursome that a single slice fills you like a meal, and for those natty little strainer-teapots that hardly drip at all (why are these not compulsory in all tea situations? Why?). You pay for the joy of being able to find cafe with real personality even when you're not in the dead centre of town. You pay for somewhere that won't chivvy you along, even if all you want to do is sit and write a very long letter over a pot of tea at 2 o'clock on a Saturday afternoon.\n","\n","I'd go back, and I'd pay again.\n","before Funky is the first word to come to mind. The place is all pinks and purples and turquoises and dark tables. Even the water jugs are purple or turquoise. There's a plasma screen showing a loop commercial for their King of Curry thing that they do, with their top media hits included. It's kind if distracting watching Jack Whitehall and James Corden crying and drinking bowls of yoghurt, but it kind of fits with the funky thing. If they took out the tables, chucked in a couple of lava lamps and cushions, and maybe tiled one wall with tiny mosaic mirrors, it'd be a cocktail bar nightclub.\n","\n","But it's a restaurant. And it is good at being a restaurant. The food hit the spot perfectly; our vegetable pakora\\/onion bhajis were soft and crispy, while my chicken korma was rich, creamy, plentiful and contained great big hunks of birdy goodness. The peshwari naan don't quite reach the giddy heights of those served at Skipton Balti in Yorkshire (nothing ever will) but they're easily the closest I've had! Sweet and flavoury (still totally a word), they're lined with deliciousness.\n","\n","The staff dealt with our considerable party size expertly, even shuffling tables in and out to match our miscounted numbers with not a rolled eye to be seen or a tut to be heard. I was surprised there was no water brought until we asked, well after the arrival of the poppadums at the start, but it was otherwise pretty flawless service too.\n","\n","It's a bit outré for my tastes in terms of decor but it's damn fine food, y'all.\n","before This is a definite treat restaurant for me. Bigger prices, smaller portions, but I find that when food is this good you don't need as much to fill you up - every mouthful counts double.\n","\n","It's stylish inside - chic yet welcoming, with a very cosy looking alcove for super-intimate celebrations. My friend and I came here on a special occasion and were delighted to be seated next to the window, looking directly across the rooftops of Edinburgh and onto the castle. The views only got more gorgeous as the sun went down.\n","\n","Last time I was here a while ago, I ordered the gnocchi, then told my waiter I might go with the risotto instead. He confided that he thought I'd be better off sticking with the gnocchi, in his opinion. (I love it when wait-staff are happy to advise on the food!) Well, this time I bravely sallied forth and had the risotto, for comparison. The gnocchi had been delicious, but the red pepper and walnut risotto was actually more to my taste! Perhaps it was a little more punchy and obvious in the flavour, but that's right up my street, and the texture was perfect.\n","\n","Our desserts had just arrived - plum tarte tatin with vanilla creme anglaise and ginger ice cream for my friend, vanilla and raspberry pannacotta with pistachio biscotti for me - when I blinked and everything got darker. Oh no! A power cut!\n","\n","Actually, it was sort of lovely to have a candlelit dinner and the restaurant looked stunning in the low light. However, we'd been there since six o'clock. The poor people who had only arrived for 7 or 7:30 were shortly to be informed that no more food could be served.\n","\n","The waiting staff immediately set about the task. Our waitress had been a cheery delight right from the off - we'd commented to each other on it right away - and now was exactly the same as she went around each of her tables in turn, explaining the situation apologetically and totting up bills with her iPhone. Almost everybody responded with equal warmth and moved on perfectly happily. I do hope nobody was unkind to the staff since it wasn't their fault at all.\n","\n","She came to us last, which we were perfectly fine with, since we'd been fortunate enough to actually have our full meal (at one point I heard her say to a table she'd just dealt with, \"Now then, where shall I go next? Who looks angriest?\"). To our amazement, despite what must have been a nightmare evening for her, she'd also remembered everything we'd had. She even knocked our teas off the bill as an apology for the circumstances - which was lovely, although not necessary. My friend summed it up as we left: \"I don't think I've had such a fun night in ages!\"\n","\n","So if you go to The Outsider, obviously you can't expect a power cut. But you can expect obscenely good food, a beautiful setting, and superhero service from start to finish regardless of the situation.\n","before I want to preface this entire review with: it really should and could be at least a four, and it's a really nice place and I liked it! I was swithering between three and two stars, but I'm giving it credit for potential.\n","\n","Guchhi really has the stuff to make itself a hero of Leith, and I regret this will read as a pretty negative review... because instead of one big flaw dragging it down, which I could mention in passing and scoot on by, there are lots of little things that will take longer to talk about, making this probably sound more like a two-star review. So, again, reiterating - it's a really nice place and I liked it.\n","\n","However, it's looking a bit tired on the outside - the door frame is peeling and tattered, but once I got in, I felt myself smile, because it's really quite lovely. Big high ceilings, clever decoration, a very lovely swinging egg chair (I WANT ONE!), warm and toasty, and a general sense of elegance.\n","\n","We came on a Groupon deal for four tapas and two cocktails at about £16 (I can't remember the exact amount) and were fully prepared for a lovely seafood feast. However, the waiter swiftly informed us that all fish was off. Shellfish, fine, but no fishywishy. It hadn't come in off the boat. Well, I mean, I thought that the good part of that was that the fish they serve is fresh, but the bad part is that the fish they serve they actually don't serve. The manner in which the news was delivered to us suggested that this is very much standard routine at lunchtimes: half the menu (at least) is out of bounds. O...kay... So I plumped for a clam starter, Sarah L had the mussels, and we both went for a chickeny thing for main.\n","\n","A big plus point is that my fear with tapas is a lack of size, and with only four between us I thought I would leave very hungry (even though we added some rice and chapatti to our order), but that wasn't an issue here. I had a bit of a job digging around to find the clams inside the shells under all that sauce, but despite their playful game of hide-and-seek, they were plentiful and tasty. My first clam experience! The butter chicken I had for main was nice - I'm not sure I'd pay the price on the menu for it, but it was nice. More my kind of thing than the clams, in fact, since I'm a fan of all things chicken.\n","\n","It's also worth noting that we had booked the deal for last week, but they rang up and asked us to change it due to some kitchen issue or other.\n","\n","The deal included cocktails, but alas, there was a mocktail fail. I think what I was delivered was actually, basically, just mango juice. It was nice, sure, but the girl had vowed some kind of mocktaily thing.\n","\n","Ah yes, the girl. There were two tables occupied - ours, and another table of two. It's quite a big place, so it's a shame that it was so empty on a Friday lunchtime in such a good location. I guess sometimes I'd be inclined to forgive cold and unsmiling service if a place were heaving with people, thinking \"gosh, it must be so tough to deal with all of these people; I know I could never do this job well\". But really, when there are four people in your restaurant, it's not hard to raise a bit of conversation or at least smile, rather than saying the bare minimum. This wasn't Voucher Treatment (I know some people say they're ill-treated because they come on a voucher) because she was like it from the off, before Sarah presented the voucher. So... she was just naturally mardy.\n","\n","So, in summary: no fish dishes (in which they're supposed to specialise), unfriendly and somewhat dilatory service, lame attempt at some kind of non-alcoholic cocktail, BUT nice place, decent food, good portions. I do want to go back, perhaps in an evening, and try it again. Because, like I said, it's lovely - or it ought to be. It's got all the potential, and it clearly has been for other Yelpers in the past.\n","before I have a dark and terrible secret. An overpowering addiction... To ribbons. Fat ones, thin ones, lacy ones, satin ones, plain ones, trimmed ones, patterned ones... I just love ribbons. And when I discovered this shop... Well, I can tell you I went a little off the rails for a while...\n","\n","I'm no sewing expert but it seems to me that this shop is missing absolutely nothing. Embroidery threads, motifs, accessories, notions and of course my beloved ribbons form the front part of the shop. Even the sales counter itself is a glass exhibition case, home to an enchanting array of flowers, crystals, feathers and other adornments.\n","\n","From that point back stretches a kingdom of fabrics of all kinds (primarily the kind you want to reach out and touch, or marvel at the richness of the colour) at reasonable prices. I can't imagine anyone not finding what they need.\n","\n","I go in here a lot. A LOT. And I always find what I need... Or just want. Given how often I go and how much I must have spent on ribbons by now, I might expect a little more in the way of acknowledgement or recognition from the staff - that'd be the five star experience. But really, they are helpful and efficient, so who's complaining? Not me, not when they have So. Many. Ribbons.\n","before FYUL is, first and foremost, a pretty risky name. Standing for Food You Utterly Love, it's a challenge, hurling down the gauntlet with a wink. Go on, it says. Try us.\n","\n","No, seriously, do try them. Step inside and enjoy the kooky decoration - there's a wall made of chopped-up doors, chairs upholstered with old tweed jackets and trousers (still bearing pockets in some cases), and the toilet door appears to have been carried straight from an old Biology classroom; it still says, appropriately, Biology. There's a long wooden table with heavy wrought-iron stools for those who favour practicality over comfort, and some squidgy armchairs in the window around low tables for those who favour the reverse. Food isn't served on plates, but on slabs of slate (not the soup, though; that would be mental). There's free Wifi (WIN) and the password is written out on battered luggage tags.\n","\n","So far, so creative. But what about this F? Will Y U L it? The little promise keeps winking at you from the menu - every F, Y, U and L in the text is highlighted red. Way to build the expectation, guys!\n","\n","Well. Well now. I have eaten here twice and both times, I did U L the F. On my first visit, I rather hazily ordered a breakfast panini and found when it arrived, to my utter delight, that it had been served with a big ol' wedge of my most favouritest fruit in the whole worldington, watermelon! I tell you, that woke me right up. I was a happy little bean right from the off, and when I snaffled down that panini it only escalated. On my second eating occasion here, I opted for the bacon, cheese and pesto panini, while my friend had butternet squash and sweet potato soup. Again, my panini arrived with unexpected fruity fun, in the form of a little dish of grapes and melon balls. The panini, too, was great, with lots of cheese and good pesto flavour, and my friend was very happy with her soup, too.\n","\n","I just need to come back and try some of that big range of cakes they've got, now. All in the name of research, you understand. Because so far, for sure, it is F I U L.\n","before Apparently, Sabor Criollo has been here for like six centuries or something (possible exaggeration) so I don't even know how I hadn't heard of it before. Were I wearing a hat, though, I would be tipping it most genially in Blythe R's direction for bringing our monthly dinner club to this adorable little beach shack in a Stockbridge basement.\n","\n","As a basement restaurant (it's easy to miss so keep your eyes peeled when you're on the right street) it could so easily be dark and claustrophobic. What they've done with the place is stellar - they've dressed the bar up as a beach shack, twined trees (and a parrot! not a real one, sadly) around the ceiling, and painted windows onto the walls with open shutters and wonderful beach views. They're not in a convincing trompe l'oeil style, instead being intentionally slightly cartoonish. The effect is actually better, because first of all trying to make them convincing is never going to work and could just be tacky, and secondly the bright colours are so lively that it has the same kind of energy level as an actual window. It tricked my brain without tricking my eyes - very smart!\n","\n","Now on to the food. I had the chilli mushroom starter, which was simply divine and I could have eaten four portions of it as a main. This was followed by chicken fajitas, Venezuelan style: wayyy less hot and spicy than the Mexican tradition, and the onions and peppers were less heavily fried, still having a considerable amount of bite and crunch. It was really nice, especially with the addition of what I called the traffic light of deliciousness - three little dishes containing salsa, sour cream and guacamole. A nice touch, too, was that the tortillas were served in a little plastic lidded pot marked \"tortilla\" to keep them warm and soft. Overall, the food didn't completely blow my head off in terms of being impressed, but I was very HAPPY. I was dancing. Seriously. Ask my dinner companions. Happy dancing in my seat.\n","\n","Finally, drinks. I ordered my usual, lime and soda, and I was thoroughly taken aback. This was no cordial'n'fizz affair. This was the real deal - fresh, bitter, and oh so good, for just £1.90, this is the place to go for a lime and soda properly.\n","before Ok, ok, ok. Hang on a sec. Say WHAT? Three courses for £7.50? Did you say that right? Right, ok, so we're talking morsels and crumbs... plates the size of teaspoons... right?\n","\n","No, indeed not, my aporetic amici! We're talking good-quality food, good-sized portions, and a warm atmosphere - the faux-Mediterranean decor might not be to everyone's taste but if you've come for the food then you won't leave disappointed. By \"good-sized portions\", I don't mean the plate is so loaded down that you'll leave dragging your tum between your legs, but enough to fill you and put a big smile on your face (try the polenta and try to stop that smile from coming).\n","\n","It's friendly and cosy, but probably because it's located next to several larger establishments, it seems to get overlooked a lot; each time I come here, I never have to wait for a table. That's not to say that it isn't well-populated with happy diners, but there usually seems to be space for a few more. If you find yourself seeking lunch in the area, I strongly suggest you make use of that space.\n","before I'm super-finicky about orange juice, but this morning as I bimbled aimlessly along the street, I had a bizarre and sudden craving for a big glass of the stuff. Boy, was I lucky to be on Nicolson Street when the craving descended: I definitely hit the right joint.\n","\n","This might seem an odd thing to rave about in a coffee shop but... the ORANGE JUICE, people. It tastes of ORANGES. When they say freshly squeezed, they absolutely mean it, and you only pay the same as you would for stuff from a carton or bottle in a restaurant. I'm seriously thinking of going back again just for another glass of the stuff.\n","\n","For those of you less inclined to be citrically overawed, there are of course other details. The service was jovial but unintrusive. The bacon was jolly good too. There's also more seating within than you might expect from a glance at the frontage; it's compact, but not crowded. At first, I was going to say that my pot of tea was fairly generous too, since it did me two and half cups, but the cup was actually weeny. Nonetheless, it's that juice that sticks in my mind like a jug of sunshine. Tasty, tasty sunshine.\n","before The Yelp five star description is \"As good as it gets\". And sure, it's not somewhere I'd tell visitors to the city to go, but as a banking experience, surely they don't come much better than this? Well, my negative point is this, and only this: it's closed on Saturdays. (I don't find the architecture remotely offensive, to briefly address the previous review for this branch). So, BoS, when you open on a Saturday, you will get a shiny fifth star.\n","\n","And now the good! The multitude of good!\n","\n","The size - it's large, and light, and spacious, and pleasantly laid out. The comfort - there are plenty of squishy seats for sitting in while waiting for your appointment. The service - the staff are super cheery and helpful, especially the lady I have talked to so many times at the enquiries desk (and whose name, to my shame, I cannot at this point remember, but I know she once lived for a while in Scarborough), and rarely have I encountered a queue in there; certainly never one that didn't move quickly.\n","\n","Seriously, I go out of my way to use this branch instead of the one nearer to me, just because I like it so much. Which, I suppose, is pretty unusual for a bank branch, so maybe it really is as good as it gets! But I'm still holding out for that Saturday opening...\n","before This is the worst thing that has ever happened to me. The Golden Bite has ruined fish and chips for me forever. Because I will never - EVER - find a fish supper superior, or perhaps even equal, to the one I had this weekend from the Golden Bite.\n","\n","I travelled to Portobello with Moray L on the express mission of trying the legendary Bite Of Gold after reading Justin G's review, and we were the first ones in when the doors opened at 16:45. The man who greeted us over the counter could not have been happier if he had been a dog in a field full of squirrels. It doesn't seem an exaggeration to say that I suspect frying fish has been his lifelong passion.\n","\n","Because we were so early, we got the first haddock to go into the fryer - clean, white haddock of gobsmacking, Jonah-swallowing proportions which the chap wobbled at us playfully before setting about the battering and frying.\n","\n","At this point - minutes after the doors opened - the shop filled. I mean it properly filled. I know not how many of these were pilgrims like us, and how many were locals, but it's clear that the reputation of The Golden Bite's fish suppers is widely renowned. I was reaching five stars simply from the cleanliness, the rich frying smell, and the chap's jollity before I'd even put anything in my mouth, and when a small girl entered and he pulled down a teddy bear to wave at her, I was smitten with the place entirely. But the food. The food. The proof of the poisson is in the eating.\n","\n","Oh. My. Wrapped lovingly in paper and carried down reverently to the seafront for consumption, these piscine Midas fillets were battered to crispy perfection, but still with the softer underside that makes a fish supper truly sensational. The chips - proper chip shop chips - were glorious and plentiful, but not so numerous as to prevent one from finishing the lustrous, luscious fishywishy that so enchanted both me and Moray. I need to go back. No, you don't understand. I NEED to go back. Now. And I don't think I will ever love a fish supper in quite the same way that I love the Golden Bite's.\n","before Oh boy. This is what I've been waiting for.\n","\n","Wayyyyy back when I was still oh so weeny and new in Edinburgh, I was hunting around for cool places on Yelp and the name of this spot showed up. \"Heh,\" I thought. \"That sounds awesome.\"\n","\n","I cannot tell you how many specific invitations to parties or outings at this very bar have come up since then (ok I can - three) and each and every time something has occurred at the last minute to prevent my going. I was starting to think I could be under a Maori curse.\n","\n","Until April's Cocktail Quest. Friends - we have lift-off.\n","\n","It's batty. It's themetastic. It's cosy and dark. It has corners and booths and flowers and weird decoupage tables. (Also, it has crazyloud music, which is the only reason it loses a star for me, in addition to which, it was reggae, which is the only - I mean ONLY - form of music I do not like under any circumstance. I mean a reggae \"Reggaeohead\" remix of Karma Police is only funny for so long.) It has a damn bonny cocktail menu.\n","\n","As is my wont as a waterbuffalo, I ordered a mocktail, giving free rein to do whatever they wanted. And, oh boy. Oh boy. What arrived was a delicious, cold, mousse-like strawberry ice cream kind of thing containing so much smooshed fruit you would not believe. It was practically a dessert, and as you know from my reviews, dessert is the reason I live. And for this cradle of bliss, what did I pay? £4, sir. Four of your tiddlysquit, if-it-says-Sterling-it's-real-even-in-London, bouncy rolling British pound coins.\n","\n","My second mocktail was a non-alcoholic take on the mojito, and as such had a more refreshing, mature, sophisticated flavour. PFFT. (It was actually completely great, but I am simply a sucker for the jungle gym playtime of a totally silly dessert-like madness of the first kind. But it was perfect nonetheless, so no marks lost. I did know what they were bringing me, after all - the waitress suggested it.)\n","\n","Talking of the waitress, she was marvellously attentive and patient, without ever becoming overly fussy over us. She was wearing a pretty cool jumper, too, as I recall.\n","\n","Praise be to Tiki, for I have found an excellent den in which to sup my exciting mocktailish creations. I might take ear plugs next time. But kudos for the live DJ.\n","before Welcome, bold adventurer, to Falko Konditormeister, den of marvels.\n","Do not hesitate at the entrance; do not baulk at the door handle shaped like a giant pretzel. You might wonder at its size, but come in through the door, travelling one, and behold the real pretzels of similar proportions within. Behold the glass counter that miraculously does not fracture under the weight of unimaginably large and intricate-looking cakes. Behold the arrayed bags of exotic teas, or the rich hot chocolate swirling hypnotically in lavish perpetual motion.\n","Your knees may weaken, but take heed: you may have to wait a while before you can sit down, for many others have already found comfort here. Here, where there is light and cheer. Here, where the denizens are quick and eager to serve. Here, where there is... cake.\n","Peruse this menu, adventurer. The options may swim a little before your eyes at first. White pomegranate tea. Hazelnut tea. Chocolate tea. And here, look: these gigantic slices of cream and liqueur, of fruit and chocolate, of pastry, of sponge - yes, these colossal confections of bliss - can be yours for less than £4.\n","Lay down your burden, and loosen your belt. You are welcome here.\n","before It all began with a goat.\n","\n","I had been goated, you see, in rough and affectionate manner, persistently and unavoidably, for a good ten minutes that morning. The goat was easily the best thing that could possibly have happened on any Tuesday morning; however, the goating had left me fragrant and somewhat besmirched ahead of a series of meetings, and I needed a quick change that didn't involve going home.\n","\n","I have this problem, you see, in that the shape of me is not the shape of most trousers, and in previous years, jeans from LTS have, in waist-ish reflection of their leggy generosity, gaped gormlessly at the waist. I have been forced to make a choice between jeans that fit at the hips and waist (oh M\u0026S, your woefully short jeans, oh how they go in at the waist, how splendid that is) and jeans that do not display my pretty floral socks to all and sundry. Despite my love of wearing jeans with heels... the short, well-fitting ones have always won out.\n","\n","However, in this time of urgent post-goat need, I decided the time had come to attempt correct length once more.\n","\n","The branch in Edinburgh is considerably larger than one might think on beholding the exterior - it goes back further than I thought, rendering it in fact larger than the erstwhile Leeds branch.\n","\n","(Side note: I cannot tell you what a relief it is to have a branch of Long Tall Sally nearby. Back when I lived in Yorkshire, my nearest branch was Leeds, a 45-minute train ride away, and then when that closed, it became York, an hour and a half and expensive fare away.)\n","\n","GREAT NEWS. They have changed the cut! These are the best-fitting jeans of my life! Sure, at £45 (£50, in fact, but 10% off if you join the mailing list at the till) they're three times more expensive than my usual purchase, but LTS clothes last and last and last.\n","\n","Now then, why is this branch in particular so good? Well, I was welcomed as soon as I walked in by a member of staff who was actually about my height. I used to feel like a complete fraud when I toddled into other branches of LTS and peered up at the giantesses all around me. I felt I was being judged for being insufficiently tall. Nonsense, of course, but hey.\n","\n","She was friendly and efficient, leading me straight to what I was looking for and picking out a selection to meet my criteria, and her colleague called through the curtain of the dressing room at one point to ask if I needed anything else. They even let me pay for them at the till while I was wearing them, snipped off the label as I stood there, and packed my goated garments into a bag for me. Bravo, LTS! I've always loved your range of clothes. Now I feel like I can actually wear them.\n","\n","*extends credit card limit excitedly*\n","before Bravo, Whisky Shop! I have been timid about entering you, for I know about as much as a wicker platypus does about whisky. I don't drink, you see, and even when I did, whisky wasn't my tipple.\n","\n","I came in here once before in search of some Caol Ila for my brother for Christmas, which he had specifically mentioned by name. I was too shy to say anything so I scootled around, nosing at the shelves, and being unable to see it (but seriously, there are SO MANY BOTTLES), I fled.\n","\n","This time, however, I didn't have a name, just the vague notion that I wanted a Lowland whisky, ideally made near to Edinburgh, that wasn't too peaty, as a good luck gift for a friend who was leaving town. I braced myself, and stepped inside.\n","\n","\"Hello,\" I said, in the bracingly chipper manner of someone who has resolved to do something, a bit like people in films introduce themselves at AA. \"My name is Cressida and I know nothing about whisky.\"\n","\n","The chap (and I regret I didn't make a note of his name) didn't blink, and his friendly expression didn't waver. \"Sure,\" he smiled. \"What are you looking for?\"\n","\n","I told him my specification and right away he knew exactly what to recommend. He showed me a range of bottles and explained the differences in how they were made and the effect that it had on the flavour, and - this is the great bit - let me know the price of each. I hate it when you get the details and have to shiftily go \"and... how much is that one? And that one?\"\n","\n","This was a chap who clearly knew his stuff, not just a bored employee bleeping bottles through the till to turn a buck. While we talked, I suddenly spotted a bottle of Caol Ila! Wow! I mentioned it to him and he explained that this one was the rare and pretty expensive 18-year version, and probably not what my brother had tried in Sandy Bell's. I had a look all the same (then hastily put it back when I saw the price).\n","\n","So, in short - my misgivings about the location (bland Princes Mall) and the shop itself (chain) were allayed by this simple process: whisky specified, whiskies identified, whiskies explained, whisky selected, whisky purchased. No fuss, no judgement, and altogether a very happy experience with good conversation thrown in. Here's to you, Whisky Shop. I raise my apple juice to your good health.\n","before Ooh, it's vair nice; all the same I wasn't swept off my feet. Perhaps that's because I didn't partake of their famous cakery when I when - just a hot chocolate. Twas a fine hot chocolate of rose-flavoured goodness, and yes, I shall be listing this review in my list of \"reviews where I mention how much I love all things that involve roses\".\n","\n","As noted by other reviewers, it's a junkyard haven of a place, full of reclaimed this and upcycled that, and we settled ourselves on a grebby but comfortable sofa. It's a difficult line to walk, I think, though, and it's all about context - namely, if you've got a front window that habitually steams up, that grebby sofa can quickly move from \"cutely unselfconscious\" to \"not out of place in student digs\". It's not that it doesn't all hang together, thematically - it's that it hangs together slightly too well.\n","\n","That said, the hot chocolate was great, and if the cakes are as yummy as I'm led to believe next time I go back (for go back I shall), I may well be donating an extra star before too long.\n","\n","Also, Ursula D is bang on. Instafollow them immediately. That's an order.\n","before I had to be there in two hours. My dress, a sturdy and somewhat matronly double-breasted affair in tough, heavy stretch cotton, had arrived in the post that morning, and bore all the signs of having been posted. My flat, still not fully furnished, contained no iron and my attempts to tame the creases with hair straighteners were limping sadly to a halt. Oh no. Oh no oh no. This was to be a big night for me - how could I show up all crinkly?\n","\n","\"Good evening, Johnsons Elm Row?\"\n","\"Hi. Hi. Um. Hi. If I bring a dress in now, like RIGHT NOW, could you - sorry - could you just... iron it for me?\"\n","\"Just press?\"\n","\"Yes, that, yes, please.\"\n","\"Just the one dress?\"\n","(At a pitch audible to bats) \"Yes.\"\n","\"Certainly.\"\n","\n","I tore up the road with the dress flying out behind me and fell gasping against the glass door, which swung open. A cheery blonde lady materialised from behind racks of coats and suchlike. \"You're wanting a dress pressed?\" A twinkle of indulgent amusement, perhaps, but no tutting, no officiousness, no bustling haste to get this ridiculous girl's frantic pleading out of the way as fast as possible.\n","\"Yes please. Thank you. I'll come back in half an-\"\n","\"Give me five minutes.\"\n","\n","She vanished again behind the racks and I gazed around at the spacious counter and the things on display. There was a good view of the street - a very nice place to wait for five minutes. She was back in three - all smiles and radiant creaselessness. I have always been supremely wary of dry-cleaners, fearing financial meltdown for little return, but this was, under the circumstances, an unexpectedly enjoyable experience. While she took the payment (less than a fiver! I had anticipated considerably higher, given the urgency of my request) her assistant hastily and elegantly packed my dress into one of those plastic covers with a hanger. I was back in my flat within 15 minutes. Pretty awesome.\n","\n","Yes, I know it's just a dry cleaner, and they sort of cleaned my dress while it was dry, so they were just doing their job. But the level of service and the attitude of the staff made this altogether a joy. I can't think that many people walk (or in my case, run) away from a dry cleaner's shop actually feeling a huge ton happier. So if ever a dry cleaner deserved five stars, it was now.\n","before I seem to remember an old advert in which a Lancastrian family was having an argument and their entire vocabulary was the word Potato.\n","\n","\"POTATO! POTATO-POTATOOO!\"\n","\n","That's pretty much what my brain shouts whenever I walk into the Baked Potato Shop.  It's definitely what my tummy's thinking. Hefty portions, perfectly cooked, fresh fillings piled on to bursting point... yes, yes, and yes.\n","\n","(And by \"hefty portions\" I mean that I, self-professed Sultana Of Starch, can barely finish the tuberous exuberance they so whimsically refer to as Small.)\n","\n","It's only a teeny shop, so if one of the staff is downstairs mixing up some more fillings you might find yourself queueing out in the cold; having only one server instead of two seems to make a disproportionate difference to the speed of the queue. But what a reward awaits the patient. Spud in abundance. Also, if you order the avocado salad from the vegetarian half of the menu (as I unerringly do), there are big lumps of cheese in it that you only notice when you eat it. And what's the best kind of cheese? Yes: SURPRISE cheese!\n","\n","The other half of the menu is devoted to vegan food, and there are vegan homemade cakes on the counter and vegan box drinks in the fridge. It's great to see vegans so comprehensively catered for instead of being an afterthought on a sub-menu. But even for a dedicated beastie-biter like me, the meat-free delights of The Baked Potato Shop are a must on a trip down Cockburn Street. I'd wager that potatoes elsewhere in the city are just green with envy over these designer jackets.\n","before The menus are battered and the new waiter, bless him, had to peer at where I was pointing on the menu to work out what I was asking for when I said \"umeboshi\" (although maybe that's my quiet voice and poor pronunciation at work) but my, my, that's some good sushi. \n","\n","I ordered the umeboshi (waaaaaa!!! PICKLY!), six salmon and cucumber maki, and two red pepper nigiri, which altogether came to £10.50. Because the maki come in sixes, I think the best way to do it is to go in a group and order a bunch of stuff between you rather than just get one type each.\n","\n","The umeboshi were super-pickled in that face-twistingly sour way - yum! The nigiri and maki were spot on - fresh-tasting, good cohesive rice, sweet and filling. I loved the weeny wasabi rolled into a little teensy blob-ball on the side of my nigiri. Too cute! That little green globe is going to be all I can think of when I hear the words \"wasabi pea\" from now on.\n","\n","Being technical, I really should give this place three stars, because it's A-OK and I had a fine time here - but it gets a fourth star mostly for the gorgeous manga on the wall. Also, the benches are comfy to sit on.\n","before Oh, THIS is how you do it. This. Right here. Classic Nouveau design in the auditorium meets chic ultra-modern comfort in the foyer.  The huge glass-fronted foyer goes up three storeys, and never feels crowded even in the pre-show buzz. I can't believe I haven't reviewed the Festival Theatre before given how many times I've come here and loved it. They do everything right.\n","\n","Unlike so many theatres of its size, the Festival Theatre is spacious and light in the foyer, and even the toilets don't feel as cramped as most theatres. The interval snack prices are no more wince-worthy than other places (we're talking £3 for a tub of ice cream - but yes, still I stick to my five-star guns, because that's not unusual).\n","\n","Even with the Playhouse in town, it holds its own with a ferocious mix of programming that spans the popular and esoteric alike, from Warhorse to the Rambert Dance Company. The shows tend to have short runs, too, meaning you get some really excitingly inventive shows with sets that are designed to tour more easily than their extended-residency counterparts. As the home venue of the Edinburgh International Festival, it's a theatre that prides itself on progressive and intellectual art while still catering to audiences of a sufficient size to populate its impressive and rich auditorium. (Standing ovations are somewhat vertigo-inducing up in the Gods, mind you - it's pretty steeply raked and you might feel safer just clinging to the arms of your chair..!)\n","\n","It even has its own tragic history and a mysterious haunting story. What more could you possibly want from a house of art and superstition?\n","before I Heart Cafe! I love tea! I love the java-jive and it loves me! Coffee and tea and the java and me - a cup, a cup, a cup, a cup, a cup!\n","\n","How strange. This place looks enormous from the outside, but it's not actually that big... Anyway, deceptive proportions aside, it's rather nice. My hot chocolate was swoonsome - rich and frothy with a big heart stencilled onto the top - and our waitress was chirpy and helpful. There was a bookcase behind me (always a good sign) and I must go back and try their food. It came to less than £9 for two lattes, a hot chocolate and a rooibos, so I'm happy financially too. Their teas are from Eteaket, so I had been hoping for a creme caramel rooibos, but they didn't have it. No worries, I've got a box at home...\n","\n","So why three stars? Well, to be honest, I'm not sure. It's not a five. It's not a four. It's definitely not a two or a one. I had real trouble writing this review, in fact, because I just couldn't really pull out any details about anything at all. It was all very nice; there was just nothing that made me think \"oh, I'd totally come here for x y or z...\" I'm not sure what it offers in the way of being unique. It's just a very nice cafe, and I do heart it for being just a sweet, no-gimmicks cafe. For sure, it's A-OK and, as I said, I'll be back to try the food sometime :)\n","before Ok, so the first thing you need to know is that the light fittings in here are little ice creams. I ain't kidding. They're adorable.\n","\n","I guess you probably also need to know about the ice cream. Well. It's stonkingly good. It's rich and creamy and at £3 a pot it's everything you'd hope. Price wise I would say that's decent for what you get.\n","\n","I tried hot cross bun flavour - ZOWEEEE! That was pure hot cross bunnity goodness. You can pick two flavours for a standard pot, which I did, but alas I cannot recall what the second was. It was very nice though. I remember thinking \"oh yes, this one is very nice too\", but I was obviously preoccupied by the hot cross bun one.\n","\n","Mary herself is a darling and makes everything in the shop herself. She's very lovely and clearly in love with her work, happy to recommend flavour mixes to the hesitant or overwhelmed. Glorious ice cream in a sweet and cute little parlour in the beautiful Grassmarket on a sunny day - what more could one wish? Thank you, Megan M, for this long-needed introduction!\n","before It's mouse-wee and, with bare wood everywhere and a Wes Anderson coffee-table book there for the browsing, well, you could say it was hipster as hell. But who cares? Is that actually a perjorative term anyway? They are a coffee shop, and so they have coffee, good coffee, although despite my recent CoffeeEpiphany™, I am very glad that I chose the hot chocolate, because... kids, let me tell you about that hot chocolate.\n","\n","It was a marshmallow in a cup.\n","\n","Now, you know and I know and the whole world knows that hot chocolate ain't worth squat if it doesn't come with marshmallow goodness, but what the world was waiting for Fortitude to show it is that putting the marshmallow on top is DOING IT WRONG. I know this now. I have seen the light.\n","\n","It was a marshmallow... In. A. Cup.\n","\n","The hot chocolate came in a little jug beside it. And as I poured that creamy yum into the cup, the marshmallow began to gooify and disintegrate, becoming one with the liquid, until only part of its mass bobbed around on the surface. And the hot chocolate was rich, and viscose, and sweet, and... revelatory.\n","\n","Now then, it wasn't a big cup, and it did cost me £3. Likewise, a very slim sliver of lemon drizzle cake, dense and moist though it was, set me back £2.60. In all honesty, this is more of a 3.5 star review, because mighty fine though those things were I didn't feel they entirely justified the price... but heck, I'll go back for another, and a blueberry bundt while I'm at it, and if that doesn't qualify for a spot of enthusiasm in the starring then what does?\n","before My bedroom when I was a young teen was blue and orange - walls, ceiling and carpet all deep royal blue; all furniture, skirting boards and door and window frames were the brightest bright orange. So in a way, walking into the orangey warmth of Rodi and enjoying its shots of deep blue felt a little bit like coming home.\n","\n","The effect was enhanced by the friendly welcome of the staff, and of course of the lovely Yelpers gathered around the table. It felt like a family dinner in somebody's vibrant, exotic home.\n","\n","Ahhh and what a dinner. The sucuk starter was blissful - chunks of spicy sausage on fresh crispy lettuce - I could eat that any day of the week and be completely happy. My main, a beautiful chicken affair, was tender, succulent, flavoursome and seriously bountiful. My mighty appetite faltered and failed me in the face of such plenty... But not so much as to eschew the offer of rice pudding for dessert.\n","\n","You all know about compartments, right? How the stomach totally has a savoury compartment and a pudding compartment? Well that's what was going on here. I was completely full in my main compartment but plenty of room for a bit of pudding.\n","\n","The rice pudding surprised me as it was cold - but I liked it a lot; rich and creamy, it was a lovely new way for me to try it. The top was burnt - I think it was meant to be that way and I could see how it was supposed to work, to give a sharper kick to the sweet pudding, but it didn't quite go, for me. I ended up scooping out from underneath.\n","\n","Aside from the front door, which had a tendency to stick open and let in the cold when someone entered or exited and meant that the staff frequently had to scoot over and close it (something they were always very prompt in doing) the restaurant is a lovely place. I imagine its location opposite the EICC will mean it's rarely short of business, especially in August. And if that means that Rodi continues for a long time to come, that can only be a good thing, because I definitely want to come back. Lots of times.\n","before I want a taxi that shows up in minutes, comes with a friendly driver, doesn't charge the earth, and is easy to book.\n","\n","That's why Central Taxis are my go-to company for scooting around the city (which I do have to do a lot, in my job, and often carrying things like a giant cake or a suitcase full of bottle openers and paper moustaches on sticks).\n","\n","They have the bestest booking line ever. You press a number to book a taxi ASAP, and then it lists your two most recent pickup locations, so if, like me, you often get the taxi from the same address, you don't have to give your address every time - just press 1. And bam. They arrive in minutes, give my phone a quick missed-call to let me know they're there, and off we go on another Yelpy adventure!\n","\n","So far, so automated, so impressive. Bring in the human element, so often the fatal weak link in a service. Bring in the drivers. Oh, these guys! I love them! They're cheery, they're chirpy, they're chatty, they're all those ch ch ch charming things. I've never had a grumpy or surly driver or one that didn't leap out to help with my bags right away.\n","\n","Central Taxis, I feel like my ever learning to drive would be a deep betrayal of our friendship. You and I are forever.\n","before Oh, sure, sure, it's not without its flaws. It's changed hands and they're not consistent on the service (I was sitting there for about ten minutes before someone toddled over my way, but to fair, I had my laptop open so I didn't really look like I was waiting). Also, I have learned the hard way that their wifi just ain't friendly. Luckily, I can hotspot from my phone with no problems, but others aren't so fortunate, I'm sure.\n","\n","But in a way, I kind of have to give 'em points for bringing me the wrong drink, because I always, always have a \"red fruits tea\" when I'm in here, and this time, I asked for redbush. The young lady taking my order (and payment at the end) got this bit right. But the staff member responsible for making and bringing my drink brought me, not what I asked for, but the similar-sounding drink that I normally have. Which is pretty cute actually, and not really grounds for feeling upset (especially since they're the same price, I think).\n","\n","The croque madame has undergone a makeover. It used to be simply bread, some ham, great melted cheese, and then the egg. No longer - now it is two entire sandwiches, filled with cheesy white sauce, topped with melty melty cheese, sprinkled with chopped ham, and egged in finery with a fried egg done just right.\n","\n","Side note: they now display their macarons on one of those confusing wizard-hat arrangements. I do not understand the magic wizard's hat of macarons that appears to be so ubiquitous. Why do they not lie flat? Why are they thus inclined to the zenith?\n","\n","Anyway, again I say - that PLAYLIST, dude.\n","before Oh! I thought this was a Metro. It's so much bigger and better-stocked than its little cousin down near my house that I just assumed it must be. (What world is this that I am able to make unconscious assumptions about the kind of Tesco I'm in? Ugh.)\n","\n","Anyway. It's bigger and better-stocked. That's why I thought it was a Metro. It's also pretty tidy most of the time and last time I went in, there was a nice young man from Stoats giving away free samples, which was fun.\n","\n","The tills are fairly well laid-out... I don't really know what else there is to say. It's a Tesco, and just a Tesco, and it's got nothing particularly out of the ordinary to recommend it, but it's juuuuuust fine.\n","before Historically, of course, the region of Dalriada was situated on the west coast of Scotland. However, it seems to have landed very comfortably after its migration across the country; now situated entirely within a magnificent turreted seafront house on the eastern coast at Portobello, it could have done a lot worse. With what estate-agents might term a \"well-proportioned\" garden and a series of bright and cosy adjoining rooms leading from the front door to the bar, it feels as much like a friend's home as it does a beach pub.\n","\n","We arrived on a Sunday to find, to my sheer delight, a session in progress. It seems that live music is a regular feature in the Dalriada week, as if its sweeping views of the ocean weren't sufficient entertainment. A session always, always means extra points from me. I wished I'd brought my mandolin so I could join in, but instead took advantage of the glorious weather to sit on the grass outside and admire the view.\n","\n","As a seaside establishment ought, it caters for pretty much everyone. The bar is well-stocked with a range of beverages and (hoorah) cakes, and they even keep water bowls behind the bar for the many dogs that romp along the sand every day. There was a great family atmosphere when I went, too - little children were out in the garden having a whale of a time.\n","\n","Something that I, a naturally queue-conscious Brit, particularly enjoyed was the bar experience. The bar room itself is a little on the small side and so, rather than the usual game of squashing around the bar and hoping the serving staff have a supernatural ability to remember the order everyone arrived in, there was a nice little linear queue that wimbled out into the next room. That queue scooted along at a good pace, too; that's impressive given the business they were getting on such an unexpectedly gorgeous day.\n","\n","It doesn't all hinge on the weather, though. It seems such a lovely place that I'm almost looking forward to the winter - I do love a bitterly cold walk along the beach and I can't think of a nicer way to round it off than with a spot of music and a hot chocolate while gazing out of the window.\n","\n","Dalriada, please don't go back to the West. Stay here forever so that I can make you part of my every trip to Portobello Beach.\n","before sda jio;das m,\\/ewa ijo'dsankfds[pw ...Oh dear. It looks like my fingers are too fat now to type. I am instead typing this laboriously using a paintbrush held between my teeth. I also fill my entire sofa, and hang over the sides. But if you seize the folds of my face and lift them to seek out the features underneath, you will see something that looks like a radiant beatific smile. Friends, I tried Burger.\n","\n","I tried a chicken katsu burger with pickles in a soft glazed brioche bun with added cheese and bacon. I tried a bag of delicious fluffy skin-on fries. I tried a chocolate milkshake with raspberries, a milkshake so thick that I had to suck harder than a Dyson to get that stuff up the straw. I tried to find the words to describe my joy, and I found only sweet, viscose tears creeping down the creamy rolls of my cheek.\n","\n","It might not be Michelin star, but I am a Michelin Man, and I am so very, very happy.\n","before Tea at 94 was the first place to become a favourite spot for me when I moved to Edinburgh, and not just because I lived practically opposite.\n","\n","The pink exterior and seriously cute signage outside give a good flavour of what to expect within, although bright splashes of colour from the cushions and artwork add a lively touch to keep it from slipping onto the wrong side of twee.\n","\n","The service is delightfully chirpy and personal, but never intrusive. Perhaps because of its location, Tea at 94 still seems to be something of an undiscovered gem, so don't come here if you like bustle; when I go with a friend we are often the only people there.\n","\n","As well as the yummy homemade cakes, there's also usually a little plate of adorable mini-pastries, which the proprietor tends to wave at us just as we're thinking we're done. They're a cheap and delicious way to extend afternoon tea just a little further!\n","\n","While teashops also sell coffee and coffee shops also sell tea, there is certain nuance in being a teashop and not a coffee shop. Tea at 94 has this down to - forgive me - a T. A delicate jumble of cups and saucers from a range of sets usually leads to the \"mine's prettier than yours\" game, and even if you're not particularly into scones, if you pass up a chance to try the jam they serve you are definitely missing out.\n","before I came here on rugby day and thought it would be packed out, but in fact there was room to move and the bar staff were being pretty speedy with service (except for me, but I wasn't giving off \"I'm waiting signals\", so entirely my fault.)\n","\n","Often have I admired its opulence from outside (like a little Victorian waif pressing up against the grubby glass to watch a family eat roast beef) but I definitely chose the right time of year to come inside for the first time - my goodness me. The opulence was raised another notch by beautiful Christmassy decorations - everywhere! Those halls were well and truly decked, but in superb taste. I felt that first twist of excitement at last! Yes, I am one of those who gladly will embrace Christmas preparations as early as October... mid-November is definitely leaving it late for me...\n","\n","As I stood there chatting away with my £1.05 lime and soda (not the most expensive I've had, but not the cheapest) a glorious aroma filled my nostrils... and past my eyes floated a plate bearing beautiful, golden and crispy-looking battered fish. Oh, but it did look good.\n","\n","I'll update when I've been back for food, but for atmosphere and decor, it's a firm and twinkly four from me!\n","before Once upon a time, not so very long ago, this was Trattoria Italiana, and it was Really Not Good. It closed shortly after I started Yelping, so it was spared the ignominy of my words.\n","\n","And now, my friends - behold! From the choking ashes of disgrace, a phoenix! From the waxy cocoon of shame, a butterfly! From the... from the grubby skip of dismay, a - er - an armchair of joy! Yes! Go with it! An ARMCHAIR OF JOY!\n","\n","(Legal note. There are no armchairs, butterflies or phoenixes in Cafe Andamiro.)\n","\n","Cafe Andamiro is good. The fact it was as busy as it was today, just a standard Tuesday lunchtime, is testament to how good. It offers the curious combination of Japanese and Korean food - curious, I think, because I think of these very much as opposites, Japanese food being very fresh and light, and Korean food being quite stodgy and greasy. But for this reason, there's probably something on the menu that everyone will like.\n","\n","Blythe R and I ordered the Korean dumplings to share as a starter, joking about how we would fight over the fifth and final dumpling, but when we mentioned that we were sharing, they in fact very kindly brought us six! They were really lovely - fried crispy on one side and very hot in the middle.\n","\n","My Jap Chae was a riot of colour, which is perfect - nobody wants a mess of brown when glass noodles are involved. It all starts to looks fearsomely biological when that's the case. But these were beautiful fresh vegetables, and it was sweet and delicious and, for the price (£5.99) HUGE. I was so full at the end that I wasn't sure I'd make it home...\n","\n","And now to my personal favourite bit. As you will see from the pictures - adorable china! Such adorable china! The green tea came in these super-cute floral teacups and a gorgeous matching teapot. The whole set was so \"KAWAII!\" (They also have a rather lovely Portmeirion Botanic Gardens soap dispenser in the little bathroom at the back, by the way). Even my Jap Chae, while Blythe's mighty bibimbap came in an ultra-impressive stone vessel like something from the Round Table, was served in a delicate little dish with a gold rim. Oh, I was so happy.\n","\n","The prices were fantastic and the service superb too. In fact, the only thing letting this place down, in my eyes, is that it feels ever so slightly on the cramped side. But for a casual lunch, it's the eel's hips! I can't wait to come back and try... all those cakes... :O\n","before It's incredible that it took me so long to try this place out because it is literally my nearest location. Nearer even than Tesco. Basically, whoever lives in the flat above the FTCS and I could pretty much play charades from our windows if we wanted to.\n","\n","(Although the catch is that we'd have to also mime the answer back, leading to much confusion. I did in fact try this once as a young teenager, playing an angel in my village church's Passion Play - my co-angel and I had to sit in silence hidden on either side of the altar for about an hour before our entrance and charades was all we had to keep us entertained. The beatific smiles on our faces when we miraculously appeared - and for which we were much praised afterward - were in fact concealed giggles at the confusion arising from attempting to convey The Sound Of Music to one another.)\n","\n","Anyway, back to the business of reviewing. Yes. Well, this is a lovely little place, albeit littler than I'd expected - you enter via a door to a small room containing the counter and menu, and are greeted (if your experience is similar to mine) with vibrant good cheer, humour and warmth. I ordered a cup of tea while my friend asked for a hot chocolate, and when the chap asked her if she wanted cream and marshmallows, I - somewhat dazed for some reason - automatically responded in the negative.\n","\n","\"For the hot chocolate,\" the guy grinned. Oh, yes, of course, for the hot chocolate. Whoops.\n","\n","Having confirmed we were staying on the premises to consume our beverages, we toddled through to the main room where we took our seats in some squishy comfy chairs beside a coffee table with pictures stuck all over it (whee!). It's nice and light due to the glass front but has a slightly shabby, ramshackle feel to it. You know that thing when you're round at a friend's and they have that cupboard full of different mugs they've collected on the way, and you just get a mug and enjoy the choice of mug you've been assigned? It felt like that. I had a nice spotted mug and I liked it. Also, my tea was excellent and, as the chappy pointed out, much better for the lack of cream and marshmallows.\n","\n","So, it's like being at a friend's house, and it's really pretty cheap (less than four quid for both our drinks together, and I've seen they also do bacon rolls for £1.60! Going to have to try that sometimes), and it's close to my flat, and it has free wifi, and so yes, yes I am a fan.\n","before I've been seen in Beanscene before, supping a post-work brew with a friend. On that occasion, I rather enjoyed the wood, the worn leather sofas, the summer sunlight through a glass wall that opens wide onto the street on hot days. We didn't stick around long but I wondered what it would be like for a spot of breakfast one morning. Having done some heavy suitcase-lugging before work today, I popped in to find out.\n","\n","Friends: sadness ensues.\n","\n","I was met with sullen weariness by the girl at the counter. Bearing in mind that it was only 9.15am, I can't in all fairness put it down to \"maybe she had had a bad day\" as I ordinarily might. Having placed my order - tea and a bacon sandwich, please - I went to sit down, opting not to sit in the big comfy sofa but instead by the (closed) glass wall to watch the morning go by for a few minutes.\n","\n","A goodly number of these minutes later, the young lady plonked my tea in front of me and wordlessly turned away to straighten the cushions on the sofa. \"Excuse me,\" I asked her back, tentatively. \"Is there any sugar?\"\n","\n","She pointed. \"Over by the trash.\"\n","\n","Ah. I trundled over and picked up a couple of sachets, noting that it was, indeed, in an intimate spatial relationship with the greasy, flip-lid bin.\n","\n","The arrival of the bacon sandwich was as unceremonious as that of the tea. Two slices of floppy granary bread appeared before me, with something baconish-looking just discernible between them, and a knife. Perhaps it's out of consideration for those who are fussy about triangles\\/rectangles, but otherwise I shouldn't have thought it was beyond a cafe to cut one's sandwich before delivering it.\n","\n","The bacon itself would have been good - nice and crispy - but it was cold; there are a few tricks to a hot bacon sandwich, one of which is not using ketchup straight out of the fridge. This sandwich was a glum disappointment.\n","\n","I am reminded that I had a nice enough time here when just having a cup of tea in the summer, but that memory is, alas, insufficient to cheer my grieving inner breakfaster.\n","before So... I have this thing about roses. If there are roses anywhere on it, or mentioned, or otherwise involved, I'm pretty much a dead cert to like it. But I confess I had some vague preconceptions of this place from the reviews I'd read and I expected something a little twee, a bit \"quirky\" in that slightly forced sense. So when I came here for the Yelp brunch I was surprised to find that from the outside it looks pretty much like any other relatively nice pub.\n","\n","Well, to be fair, quirk it has in abundance inside. The halogen lights are shaded by upturned teacups in translucent bone china. Around the top of the room, hats in all styles and colours hang on rose-shaped hooks. Menus arrive in old copies of National Geographic. The teapot in which our tea arrived was an adorable porcelain cottage. But it's not a try-hard kind of place; despite the kooky notes, it's also a genuine, solid pub. It's cosy, warm, well-stocked with a good range of drinks.\n","\n","I was transfixed, too, by the juicer, which provided me with apple juice so fresh and pulpy that I could stand my straw upright in it, and served with a merry slice of apple that presented the whole thing, rather charmingly, like a cocktail. That kind of fruity joy explains the hefty £3 price tag, which I would gladly pay again.\n","\n","There was a good number of us, yet they managed to serve us all pretty quickly. My meal was the last to arrive but I didn't feel I'd been waiting an unfairly long time. The big breakfasts on griddles looked incredible and super-generous, and I heard good reports about the French toast too.\n","\n","I went for Eggs Florentine. To be honest, I was a little disappointed with the eggs themselves; I like the yolks of my poached eggs to run free like liquid scamps on the playground of my food, but these smiled orangely up at me in regrettable stasis. I suspect that this might simply have been a side-effect of having to poach eggs for about half of our rather large party in quick succession, though; both the wilted spinach and the toast were done to perfection, so it was still a really lovely meal, and a snip at £5.95.\n","\n","The whole experience was easily worth the long walk to Leith from my house (which also justified the indulgence... yum yum!) and I feel very certain I'll be back before too long to enjoy it all over again. Yup, this place is coming up smelling of roses!\n","before It's really nice here - comfortable booths and seats, and lots of space. It feels kind of diner-ish, but with a hint of cocktail bar vibe too. Their gin and tonic menu is wonderful - following our tutorial at One Square I now know how important the right tonic is and they explain on the blackboard which tonic will be served with which gin (including the Caorunn and Fentiman's pairing offered at One Square). Much better than just dumping a Schweppes into everything!\n","\n","I had the haddock and chips, which was really quite delicious. Sure, I said in my last fish supper review that I was ruined for fish'n'chips forever, but I think the indoor dining experience is somewhat different, and these weren't chippy chips; rather, they were skin-on wedges. It wasn't as plentiful as I might have hoped, though, given the price of £11 (when is haddock and chips ever the second priciest thing on the menu?) - there were probably about twelve wedgey-chips although there were two strips of haddock fillet, which were tender and falling apart beautifully, and the batter was wonderful. The buttered peas, oddly, were the highlight - very sweet and flavoury (I told you, it's totally a word).\n","\n","Our waitress seemed a little brusque in her manner, but was very efficient and helpful nonetheless, and I really appreciated that the music wasn't banging at a massive volume. What I did hear was a good playlist too - Joni Mitchell, Paul Simon, Radiohead - applause for that.\n","before The heady scent of incense filled the air in Bindi as the Yelpers gathered for their vegetarian Indian Thanksgiving. The chairs were squashy and high-backed, arranged around a quirky T-shaped table arrangement. Among those of us seated next to the large and beautifully-decorated plate glass window, there was a little shuffling and struggling to slip in and out, but the passing of plates and dishes to those least accessible made for a fun party game and added to the celebratory atmosphere of our gathering. Tanya L had brought hand turkeys, and Julie G, in addition to Gobbles the turkey Beanie Baby, who served as our table mascot, had brought two big boxes with her containing pumpkin pie. The staff, far from being offended that we'd brought our own dessert, were more than happy to take them into the kitchen until they were needed, and even brought out a specially-made pumpkin curry to add to our dinner!\n","\n","With two gluten-free diners among our number, the waitresses were also quick to go and check suitable dishes with the kitchen. Clad as they were in stunning fitted dresses heavily laden with mirrors and detailed embroidery, it was a joy to see them float around the restaurant with giant smiles. It felt like they loved being there as much as we did. I had a chat with one of the waitresses about the gorgeous outfit and she confessed she had been thrilled at the opportunity to wear it when she began working there.\n","\n","Looking at the prices on the menu, I assumed that all the dishes would be tiny tapas-like things, so I ordered two from the starter-ish part of the menu, and a side on my main, knowing full well that Julie G's pumpkin pie was still to come for dessert. Big mistake! It's a wonder I could drag my bulk all the way home after a bunch of little square poppodums, some of Claire L's delicious sweet potato crispy curls, three amazing batata vada (sort of fried spicy potato patties), a grated carrot salad the name of which I can't remember, a thali served in five silver dishes, and a royal raita of seasoned yoghurt topped with what I think was pomegranate seeds. And whenever I felt like my mouth was on fire from all of the spices (perfectly balanced to create, not disguise, flavour) I took a sip of my passion fruit juice. Yes, indeed, passion fruit juice. Why does EVERYWHERE not serve passion fruit juice? I had two glasses of that stuff. And what did my bill come to for everything I ate (apart from the sweet potato curls I snaffled off Claire and the delicious slice of Julie's pie?) £13.50. I know, right?!\n","\n","It took a bit of fiddling and faffing among us to sort out our bills individually at the counter but the staff remained helpful and cheery throughout the whole confusion, which ended the night with as much warmth and affection as with which it had begun.\n","\n","They're starting cookery classes here in January. If it'll teach me to make food even half as good as what I had last night, I will be sorely tempted.\n","\n","tl;dr version of this review: Go here.\n","before How do I love thee, Brew Lab? Let me count the ways. I'm told you're super coffee heroes, to those that are qualified to discuss such matters. Well, here's a star for being great at everything non-coffee AS WELL. Yes, your hot chocolates are divine. Your tea selection includes my new favourite, lavender rooibos.\n","\n","Here's a star for the fact you sold me a plum. An actual plum. A 50p plum. Your fruit bowl is more than just apples and bananas, for you sold me a plum.\n","\n","Here's a star for recognising me when I come in and for being so welcoming every single time.\n","\n","Here's a star for your excellent and reliable free Wifi, and even for your smart idea to switch it off at lunchtimes, which, while it might inconvenience folks like me, is actually a really clever plan because you know you're hot enough to get business at that time simply on the basis of your own product.\n","\n","Here's a star for your decor, or lack of. Even when your front window got spidered by some blunt object recently, and I felt my heart form similar patterns at the brutal attack on a place that is now, essentially, a piece of my soul, you somehow owned it. Your exposed bricks and mortar, your unfinished corners, your ramps and slopes on the wooden floor - all is perfection, kooky and raw without being too hipsterish.\n","\n","Here's a st- oh wait, I hit five already. Well, good job, Brew Lab, good job. Good job from someone who doesn't even come here for the thing you specialise in. You are superheroes indeed.\n","before OooOoOoOOOOoooo. Bangers and mash make me a happy lady. My tum is thanking me even now, eight hours later.\n","\n","I came here for lunch with Sally L and between us we sampled the herby sausage, plain sausage, and one of the day's specials, a pork and ale sausage; chipotle mashed potato and cheese and onion mashed potato; and tomato gravy and caramelised onion gravy. Goodness me.\n","\n","The sheer enthusiasm for the menu shown by our waitress, the delight she took in recommending her favourite dishes (the venison is a winner, apparently) and helping us to choose the best combination of sausage, mash and gravy was worth the fifth star in itself. But the food didn't let this down - super flavoursome, obviously good quality, and very hot. I had a chocolate milkshake, too, which was just as a milkshake should be; ice cream based, and thick enough to stand a straw in.\n","\n","I'll be back for sure! I was having an iffy morning and lunch here was just what the doctor ordered to set me back on track and go into the weekend with my head held high! And my stomach held in my hands...\n","before It was a Sunday. My brother was visiting. What else do you do with family on a Sunday... it was time for Sunday Roast! The Fountain having some good roast reviews here on Yelp, we decided to check it out. Muted sage-teal walls make a fresh but homely atmosphere and we were greeted immediately with swift and bright service. We hadn't booked ahead but we had a drink at the stylish yet cosy bar while a table came free (which was surprisingly quick - less than ten minutes - but we were there at six-ish so quite early).\n","\n","When we ordered, there was only one pork belly left. (Sunday roast sold out by 6 on a Sunday? Really?) My brother opted instead for the shoulder of lamb. Our food arrived fairly quickly and at first it didn't look like there was very much there, but the vegetables joined us later. The pork was amazing - really juicy and tender - and there was a really well-proportioned Yorkshire pudding. Peas and carrots were served separately and to be honest, I thought the bowl they arrived in was just for one person, until another didn't follow and I realised we were sharing. The peas were great and lots of beetroot but the carrot mash was slightly on the cold side. However, everything tasted delicious.\n","\n","Because the portions were slightly on the small side, we did decide to have dessert. I say \"because the portions were small\" but who am I kidding? I almost always have dessert regardless... Anyway, we both ordered the cheesecake and we decided to push the boat out and also get a cheeseboard to share. But alas! There was also only one cheesecake left! My brother, ever the gentleman, once again switched his choice, and plumped for the sticky toffee pudding at the waitress's recommendation.\n","\n","Good gracious. GOOD GRACIOUS. Such a cheesecake shall I dream about in years to come. It was so good I had to give my brother some to try, and so good that I grieved to part with a forkful when I did so. His pudding was also excellent; sticky toffee pudding can so often come out either stodgy and chewy or loose and partly dissolved. This was neither; sticky toffee perfection. But back to my cheesecake... unfff. The base was crumbly and biscuity and full of flavour. The top was sturdy and creamy without being gelatinous. The berries and compote gracing that heavenly cake were round and piquant. This is definitely the best cheesecake I have ever had in a restaurant, and possibly anywhere.\n","\n","The cheeseboard was just the right size for two people as a rounding-off course after dessert, with oatcakes and a selection of cheeses including brie, Stilton and cheddar. There was also a small tub of frozen grapes, which I've never encountered before, but which were rather delightful.\n","\n","Following a coffee for him and a lavender rooibos for me, we toddled over to the cinema across the road. \"I think I'm going to need another coffee before the film,\" my brother confided, trailing off to find one. \"Otherwise, sitting in a comfy chair in a warm, dark room can only lead to immediate sleep after a great meal like that.\" A great meal it sure was.\n","before Hired #BombayGrille to cater for my daughter's wedding because this business was the preferred caterer for #BentonConventionCenter in Winston-Salem and recommended by them. Food tasted very well. To my dismay, the quantity for biryani and kabobs turned out to be very short despite the fact that the number of guests who showed up were less than the number paid for. This was very embarrassing for me and the only sore point during my daughter's wedding. Bride, groom and the guests at the back of the line didn't get food. I was later told by some friends that they had encountered food shortage at another wedding where food was catered by #Bombaygrille. Unfortunately I found this out too late. I would not recommend them to hire for an important event such as a wedding.\n","before I visited Nolen Kitchen midday on a weekday to buy a $50 gift card for a friend of mine with a very sick child. We'd taken up a collection and I went to 5 different restaurants for 5 different gift cards so they wouldn't have to worry about dinners.\n","\n","The restaurant was empty when I showed up. I asked the hostess about getting a gift card. She looked confused. She told me to go wait by the bar. So I waited while she asked someone else who gave her the name of someone who would have to get the gift card for me.\n","\n","Turns out, I had to wait for the MANAGER to ring up the gift card and well, they informed me he was in the bathroom.\n","\n","I waited for TEN minutes, growing more and more impatient. All of the other restaurants were able to get me rung up and out within 5 minutes, and I didn't have a lot of time to spare as I was making purchases from two more restaurants after this one.\n","\n","The manager came out, all apologies for not being out sooner. I was glad he didn't offer to shake my hand. Then, after making me wait a few minutes more, he came back and told mt their gift card system WAS DOWN...\n","\n","FIFTEEN MINUTES for a manager to get out of the crapper and tell me that he couldn't take my $50 in exchange for a gift card. What an incredible joke, and a bad one at that.\n","\n","I was disappointed for my friend, who apparently likes this backwards, screwed up place, but relieved that they didn't get any of our money that day. Based on their ability to royally screw up what was a five minute transaction at five other restaurants, I wouldn't recommend daring them to actually cook and serve a meal.\n","before The airport overlook is a little out of the way, but once you find the signs it's easy to get to. Unfortunately, planes on the runway nearest the overlook tend to be taking off, not landing. This means that they take off usually about halfway down the runway, a ways off from the overlook. If you can get to the overlook when the winds are out of the south instead of the north, I imagine you'll get a much better view of planes landing rather than taking off.\n","\n","There are picnic tables for a nice picnic, and plenty of benches right at the front of the overlook. It's a great place to visit on a sunny afternoon.\n","before Ever go to a restaurant and get met by someone with a sour face and a surly attitude? That won't happen at Lebowski's. If there's one thing I notice every time, and as my husband will tell you, COMMENT on every time, it's how friendly everyone at Lebowski's is. \n","\n","We first tried Lebowski's after my husband heard about the authenticity of their Buffalo wings. The owner is from Buffalo, I believe, and it IS the Buffalo Bills bar in Charlotte. I went a few hours out of a trip up north just to have wings at the Anchor Bar in Buffalo, so my husband knew I'd be on board with trying a joint known for its authentic wings.\n","\n","We visit Lebowski's most often on Sunday around midday. Football games are on the television, and the routine is pretty much the same for me. My husband mixes up his orders, and his beers, depending on what they have on tap. I'm a horrible beer drinker (Bud Light, I consider it my karmic punishment for drinking so much beer) and a sucker for fish and chips, so that's what I get every time. Oh, in addition to an order of Buffalo wings.\n","\n","The first time the server asked me if I wanted the \"junior\" size fish and chips, I asked her what she thought, since I'd never seen the serving size before. Fortunately she told me it would be fine. I have to wonder what the \"full\" size fish and chips is like, because the \"junior\" size takes up a massive plate!\n","\n","The food is delicious. The environment is a million kinds of awesome, with the \"Dude\" theme going in full force. And as I said, the people who seat you, take your orders and bring your food are so nice I might invite them to Thanksgiving dinner next year.\n","\n","\"Neighborhood grill\" describes Lebowski's perfectly. We live several neighborhoods south of Lebowski's, but are willing to make the drive every time we come here. Some Sundays I just wake up and mutter, \"Lebowski's?\" to my husband when I first see him. It's just that good.\n","before Southern Spirits wins 4 stars (\"Yay! I'm a fan.\") from me for a few reasons: 1 - I can go to SS, purchase alcohol, and be back in my nice suburban home consuming it in under 10 minutes. 2 - There's a fireworks store in the parking lot, and if that doesn't scream South Carolina brilliance\\/insanity then nothing else does. 3 - Their prices are pretty good, with discounts for cash, and I can find everything I want there, and more. Finally, if you want Hawaiian-style shave ice, or classic Carolina barbecued pork butt and\\/or ribs, you can get it in the parking lot of Southern Spirits. (The \"Tropical Sno\" is available every day throughout the summer, and Gilb's barbecue is there on the weekends.)\n","\n","There are some negatives, that cause me to dock them at least one star. First, at least on the beer side, the cashiers can be surly. I've been going there at least once a week for about five years now, and it's still hit or miss if the cashier woman, who has seen me at least 100 times, will smile at me or grimace and not even give me a second glance.\n","\n","Second, their hours suck. They close at 7PM during the week and on Saturdays. Half the time I usually know we'll need another bottle or a six pack for some folks dropping by after the time at which they have closed. And they aren't open on Sundays - stupid, ridiculous, stinking blue laws... which frankly shoot the state in the foot when it comes to revenue.\n","\n","Frankly, I don't care much if they're surly, I'll still return to Southern Spirits for the convenience. I keep my expectations low, which make days like today a great surprise! Apparently they were stocked up to the gills for the Labor Day weekend - no sooner had I pulled my 12-pack from the fridge, a young man was behind me asking me if he could carry it to the register. And when I checked out, I had a more senior (she's the manager, I think) woman who rang me up for $10.25 and when I plopped $11 on the counter, she whipped out a quarter from her own pocket and gave me my dollar back.\n","\n","Regardless of the attitude you (might) get, they're down home folks, and you're supporting local business (rather than the Wal-Mart) so I will always keep going to Southern Spirits!\n","before Rush Espresso is our new \"go to\" coffee hang in Ballantyne Village. Paul pulls a fantastic espresso, or any other drink you want to order. The atmosphere is modern and chic, and a cyclists dream hangout. In addition to coffee, their panini sandwiches are delicious, and the Australian Sticky Cake is to die for as a late night dessert. \n","\n","If you're tired of the suburban Starbucks and you wish you could get better coffee in a place with a more authentic, European feel, I highly recommend Rush. And if you walk by and see Paul back there making the drinks, you owe it to yourself to go in and try a latte. His are the absolute best you'll ever try!\n","before Bad Daddy's food is very good but service and attitude can be a little spotty at this location. \n","\n","Specifically, Bad Daddy's is a poor choice for group get togethers. Last month, a group of 10 of us had reserved a table right at 5PM for a post-work get together. The restaurant was nearly empty when 6 of us showed up - 2 folks had a firedrill come up at the office they were tending to and the other 2 had gotten lost on the way to the restaurant. The hostess refused to seat us until everyone else arrived, which we found ridiculous, given that at most, 2 other tables in the restaurant were occupied and no one was waiting for a table besides us. We wanted to sit down after a long day and have drinks while we waited for our friends, but we couldn't do that until everyone was rounded up and accounted for.\n","\n","I completely understand this policy at peak hours, when you can't have 2 people taking up a table for 10, but to set the policy in stone at non-peak hours when the restaurant is empty isn't good business. They lost extra drink sales while six of us stood awkwardly at the front door of a nearly empty restaurant waiting for a few minutes. Finally when the 2 lost teammates arrived they relented and gave us a table for 8, which they made sure we knew was \"against their usual policy\". With a sea of empty tables around us they wouldn't pull over an extra two top until our coworkers who had to deal with an issue at work arrived 20 minutes later - when the restaurant was still cavernously empty.\n","\n","The food at Bad Daddy's is very good but I'm not a traditional burger fan. On this last visit, I searched for my favorite, the Banh Mi burger (which is a pork burger) only to find it's been taken off the menu. I had a hard time choosing between all of the other options, since they didn't really appeal to me. It's a shame they removed my favorite option. Their menu is somewhat limited.\n","\n","If other people want to go to Bad Daddy's, I'll go with them, but after this last visit, I see no reason to initiate going there myself.\n","before We reserved a table at Cafe Monte last Saturday for a special occasion dinner. The front half of the restaurant really does feel like a french bistro, and with a wonderful duet of a trumpet player and a piano player, the music was great.\n","\n","Service was attentive. We brought a bottle of wine from our cellar and corkage was $15. Our server noticed the bottle in its neoprene carrier as soon as she showed up and asked if we had white or red, and what style glasses we wanted. \n","\n","My husband and I were both dying to try the steak frites, since we loved that dish in our favorite restaurant Paris. He ordered his au poivre, and I ordered mine with Bearnaise sauce. I'm docking Cafe Monte one star because they completely undercooked my steak. I ordered it medium, and I received a steak that was rare, as in cool in the middle. My husband ordered his medium rare and he also received a rare steak.\n","\n","I prefer my steaks medium, but will eat just about any steak on either end of the spectrum of doneness so as to avoid sending it back and risking spit, so I kept my mouth shut. Be prepared to have your steak undercooked if you eat here.\n","\n","Aside from that one issue, everything was great. Hopefully they'll get some more knowledgeable cooks in the kitchen in the future.\n","before Visited Chaupaati for lunch yesterday, after reading about their recent opening here on Yelp.\n","\n","Tucked away in the Bi-Lo shopping center at the intersection of Park and Pineville-Matthews Rd, Chaupaati is the first \"casual\" Indian restaurant I've visited in the south Charlotte area. \n","\n","The restaurant is clean, modern and cozy, with a counter directly ahead as you enter for ordering your food. There are large flat-screens on the walls brightly displaying the menu items. Once you've placed your order, there is a small station to the side to pick up silverware, napkins, and small glasses for water. The restaurant is packed with tables, so there shouldn't be a shortage of places to eat even if you're there during a rush.\n","\n","Bishal greeted me from behind the counter and took my order. He inquired if this was my first visit, and was very friendly and helpful. While Chaupaati sells a variety of authentic Indian street food (chaat), I had to go with my standard -  (non-authentic, I know) Chicken Tikka Masala as a first order. \n","\n","I was able to get a lunch portion for $3 less than the $11.99 dinner portion. When my food was ready, I initially thought the smaller portion might be too little, but it ended up being just enough food when paired with a full order of naan for just $2.\n","\n","My order of CTM was very flavorful, although the gravy was more of a curry style tomato gravy with less cream than I've had in other preparations. I had no complaints though, it was still very tasty! The naan was okay, if a little more dry than I'd like, although once it was dunked in the gravy, it was perfect.\n","\n","This is a great new restaurant with very friendly owners and staff. There seemed to be a few \"regulars\" in there already even though they've only been opened a short time. The only thing I could honestly complain about, although it's trivial, is that I wish there were larger glasses by the water dispenser. I always drink water with my meals, and I drink a LOT. A six ounce glass just doesn't cut it for me, so I ended up filling up two at once, and still made a couple of trips.\n","\n","I'm excited for this new addition to south Charlotte's restaurant scene. I always feel like so many Indian restaurants are buffet-only at lunch and\\/or are simply too formal for me to drop in by myself to eat at lunch without feeling a little uncomfortable. While my husband loves Indian food, a number of my friends don't (which is truly unfortunate) so I'm usually a solo diner at lunch during the week. I'm glad to have a casual go-to for Indian fare and look forward to more visits in the future!\n","before You know what? For what it is, this Showmars is top notch. A five star review doesn't = a five star restaurant experience of course, but if you want casual fast food in a clean environment, at a reasonable price and with polite staff, Showmars is the place to get it. \n","\n","The menu is interesting, a combination of casual Greek food, burgers and seafood. I've tried several of the Greek menu items, as well as the fish sandwich and the Calabash shrimp plate. Everything I've had has been top notch, but if I have to ding them for anything - and it's not enough to take off a star - they don't carry malt vinegar in the restaurant which seems a shame because that's all it would take for them to have a killer fish and chips meal!\n","\n","My favorites are the crinkle cut fries, the hush puppies, their cole slaw, tzatziki and Greek salad. Every order I get fills at least one or two of those cravings.\n","\n","Table runners are spot-on to refill drinks or get you anything you need. The only thing is I feel guilty about not leaving a cash tip, since there's no room to tip on a card at the register, and I go cashless almost 100% of the time. One of these days I'll pack a wad of singles into the console of my car so I can leave the table runners a buck or so for their fast and friendly service. As it is, I often sit close enough to the drink machine to grab my own refills and I self-buss my own mess. It's the former waitress in me coming out.\n","\n","Good for singles, couples, families, lunch or dinner. Not a romantic joint, but doesn't try to pretend it is. You can even phone in an order and pick it up at their drive-thru window. Not much more you can ask for. Well, maybe a little malt vinegar...\n","before Tried this restaurant for the first time over the weekend. On Fri\\/Sat\\/Sun, the buffet was the only option. The food on the buffet was not very good. The Chicken Tikka Masala had no flavor, while the Chicken Biryani had plenty of flavor, it just wasn't a flavor that I liked. They had Mango Lassi drinks in glasses by the buffet, but the drink was warm, which is never good in a Mango Lassi. The 87.5 sanitation rating also threw me off.\n","\n","The restaurant is in a nice spot. I was actually hoping for a more casual style Indian restaurant, since this seems to be a chain, but it's a traditional sit down restaurant. Bim (sp?), formerly of Blue Taj, was running the restaurant the day I visited.\n","\n","I don't know if the dishes would suffer so much individually if ordered off the menu. I have noticed that the Chicken Tikka Masala on a buffet always seems worse than a fresh version of the dish. I just know that I was not impressed at all by the quality of what was on the buffet. I hope they do well, but I will probably not return for the buffet, and I'll definitely wait for that sanitation score to go up before I return again.\n","before Went today with a party of eight for a business lunch and I have to say Aria far exceeded my expectations.\n","\n","Service was quick and competent, although they never took a drink order so we all ended up drinking water. I'm sure if someone was really jonesing for a soda or tea they would have made it obvious, but instead we all just enjoyed the water and the frequent refills.\n","\n","My steak salad was phenomenal. The steak was served over arugula with fresh mozzarella and a balsamic vinaigrette with some roasted peppers. It was fantastic and I would order it again in a heartbeat.\n","\n","Everyone else really enjoyed their dishes too, from chicken parmesan to risotto. The first comments from the group as we started to eat were that the food was so much better than you usually get at lunch.\n","\n","I'm sure Aria has its ups and downs, but we clearly hit it at an \"up\" time. I will bring other people back for lunch again.\n","before After my last hairstylist \"broke up with me\" by moving to Wisconsin (what-EVER!) I decided to go \"low maintenance\" for awhile, coloring my own hair and getting my bangs trimmed at a local cheap walk-in place. That is, until the cheap walk-in place (see my other reviews) butchered my bangs so badly it took months to grow the remaining bits out. That's when I realized I needed to pony up the money to go to a real salon. I chose Armis Salon based on the reviews here on Yelp and elsewhere.\n","\n","Armis herself was behind the desk and greeted me warmly when I entered. She was my stylist, and I couldn't be happier with the results! First, she took plenty of time to look at my hair and talk to me to understand what I was looking for. She carefully tousled her way through my hair checking the cowlicks and texture, and asking about what side I parted my hair on, and what I might consider. She even managed to get it looking pretty good with some skillful maneuvers and said, \"Something like this?\"\n","\n","Yes, something exactly like that, please. After we talked through colors, she was off to the races, getting me started with partial highlights, then finally cutting my hair.\n","\n","The resulting cut and color was exceptional by my standards. I'm the type of person who can't wait to leave a salon so I can go home and \"re-do\" my style more how I like it, but Armis' work was perfect and I left absolutely happy and satisfied.\n","\n","What I liked most about Armis was that she talked with me and got to know me and my hair. And better yet, when she styled my hair at the end, she instructed me step-by-step on how to achieve the same looks she was magically pulling off. She recommended I purchase some clips (and told me where to buy them) to help with styling, and recommended a hairdryer with brush attachment from Target. \n","\n","Leaving with not only a great cut, but also the information and tools I needed to keep it looking fabulous, was something I've never experienced before. Armis and her salon are fantastic, and I can't recommend her highly enough!\n","before My husband and I returned to Ilios Noche, as we do nearly every year, to celebrate our anniversary last night. Having honeymooned in Greece, Ilios Noche for many years was the closest we found in Charlotte to the food we ate there.\n","\n","We were sat promptly for our 6:45 reservation. We called ahead to inquire about corkage fees, and found that there is no corkage fee for the first bottle of wine you bring to Ilios Noche, and a $15 fee for every bottle thereafter. For us, and our one bottle of wine that we have saved since 2007 to drink, it was a great deal!\n","\n","Erika was our server, and she was fantastic at her job. We didn't want for anything. The food was spectacular. I ordered the Greek style pork ribs, and my husband ordered a lamb dish with orzo. The pork ribs were perfectly cooked, and easily eaten with a fork. Very tender, smoky and lightly flavored. We also ordered a sampler of all the dips (htipiti, hummus, tzatziki and an eggplant dip) as an appetizer. They brought us multiple pita bread refills until we'd conquered the appetizer, for which we were very appreciative!  Everything about our meal was perfect. I've been looking forward to the leftover ribs for lunch all morning!\n","\n","Ilios Noche is expanding in a couple of weeks which hopefully helps with the space concerns noted in other reviews. Erika told us they hope to stay open through Mother's Day, doing construction on \"the other side\" of the soon-to-come-down wall in order to minimize their downtime. The sign at the restaurant said they're expecting to host a grand re-opening in June.\n","\n","I highly recommend Ilios Noche, and learning about the free corkage on the first bottle of wine last night really puts them up there on places I'd recommend in Charlotte.\n","before Visited for a quick drink and bite to eat at the bar before a concert. Parking's tough, but service was friendly. \n","\n","Ordered the corn fritters, and it took about 25 minutes for them to come from the kitchen, at 6PM on a Thursday when the restaurant wasn't terribly crowded. This meant I had to wolf them down quickly in order to make it to our concert on time.\n","\n","I really wasn't impressed with the dish. The fritters were oily and tasted burnt. It tasted like the fryer oil hadn't been changed in some time, and there had been several items burned in it previously.\n","\n","The fritters were also lava-hot, which is normally a plus in a restaurant when you have time to eat them, but not in this situation when I had only about 5 minutes to finish all of my $8 dish.\n","\n","I wouldn't go out of my way to visit the Peculiar Rabbit, but I hear they have a great rooftop view (haven't been up there) and they are rather close to Oven's Auditorium so if I'm back in the area, I'll give them another try.\n","before My husband and I tried Liu Liu's in Baxter Village last night, with his parents. The four of us ordered steamed dumplings and four entrees. My husband had a coupon to get one entree free with the purchase of another entree of greater value, so we used that coupon last night.\n","\n","We arrived just after 5. Our dumplings were good, but the entrees weren't anything special. After we received our dinner, service began to slow down considerably, even though the restaurant was nearly empty. We were sat in the farthest corner on the left as you come into the restaurant, and no one ventured far enough back to check on us.\n","\n","As a result, we had to flag someone down to get the check. We put down two credit cards and our coupon, to split the check evenly. After waiting for them to get our cards for well over 10 minutes we had to flag them down again. The woman took our cards to process them. She came back a short while later, dropped off our slips and left quickly.\n","\n","We soon found out why: she had *handwritten* out the tip and totals on the credit card slips! She had written in a 25% gratuity on each slip and totaled it up, leaving it for us to sign, and left without any explanation. This was outrageous. Nowhere on the menu or anywhere else did we see that having a party of 4, splitting a bill across 2 credit cards, or using a coupon would result in us being forced to leave a 25% gratuity!\n","\n","The service didn't warrant a 25% gratuity and we found this behavior extremely unprofessional. We will not visit this restaurant again and I would warn others away too unless you want to be hit with a forced 25% gratuity on your credit card slip!\n","before I headed into Young Plantations\\/Reid's Fine Foods today for the first time in about three years. My next-door neighbor's husband suffered a minor stroke late last week and I really wanted to bring something nice over for them that was beyond the flowers\\/balloons type of \"Get Well\" gift.\n","\n","I wandered about the store a little aimlessly looking at their gift baskets of snacks. A woman approached me, and asked if she could help me - her name was Theresa. I told her what I was looking for: Something heartier than snacks, something that could save them some time. She suggested a delicious looking house-made frozen lasagne from their freezer case that I decided to pair with a nice bottle of red, for when he can drink wine again.\n","\n","Theresa went in the back and magically turned these two things into a lovely gift, with heat-shrunk plastic and a spring-like series of tulle bows and ribbons that didn't look too \"girly\" at all. She gave me a card to fill out, and then incorporated it into the gift.\n","\n","I jokingly mentioned that I had bought the wife one of those \"freeze your own\\/liquor included\" Margarita drink packs from Harris Teeter a few minutes earlier, since she was no doubt incredibly stressed. Theresa said, \"Bring it in, I can wrap it up for her!\" She took the drink pack and in a few minutes appeared with it in a festive bag and more curled ribbon. Brilliant! She didn't even charge me for that.\n","\n","I asked about the Reid's Fine Foods items available throughout the store. Theresa informed me that Young Plantations bought Reid's and that this was now a satellite type of store for their foods. (I loved Reid's Fine Foods uptown, and not just because I share a last name with them!) The quality of Reid's foods are definitely present in this offshoot store, and I heard another staffer mention that in the future they hope to offer fresh meat at this location as well, eventually. Currently, they have an outdoor farmer's market type setup for fresh produce. You have to buy your produce outside separate from what you buy inside. Still, it's a great place to get fresh local fruits and vegetables. \n","\n","Thanks to Theresa and Young Plantation\\/Reid's Fine Foods, I was able to bring over a festive, put-together gift that was a lot more practical than flowers or a balloon. I'll definitely be heading back there anytime I need a gift of food from the heart for friends!\n","before First things first - I am a road cyclist and a spin class junkie (though I prefer the term \"aficionado\"). Last week, I posted the following to my Facebook status after yet another predictably boring YMCA spin class, \"If 90+% of your class has us out of the saddle or doing ridiculous 'jumps', it's not a cycle class. It's an elliptical class. It is also a waste of my time.\"\n","\n","After reading that Facebook status, a friend of mine sent me an invitation to the \"Open House Week\" at Flywheel Ballantyne. I had never heard of Flywheel before, but my friend said they were offering free classes all week and suggested we try them. I wrote her back saying, \"Given what they charge, I'm interested in seeing how - if at all - this is different from a general spin class.\" Frankly, having spent hundreds of hours in YMCA spin classes over the past 3 years, I was not expecting much.\n","\n","I told her as I gripped the handrail down to the parking lot to steady my legs after our first Flywheel class together: \"I was wrong.\"\n","\n","I *know* your average spin class. Nothing fazes me anymore. I'm not the most fit looking person in the room, but this bod was built to spin and spin hard. I went into the Flywheel class with the mindset that it was cute and theatrical with dim lights and stadium style elevation for the bikes, but that it probably wouldn't be very challenging. \n","\n","As I said though, I was wrong. There are some key things that Flywheel does that make it much more challenging than your everyday, garden variety spin class.\n","\n","First, there is the \"tech pack\" attached to every bike. Most spin classes have a manual dial, or a dimly lit display that shows your RPM's and other stats. You can walk in, saddle up on a bike, and sandbag the whole damn workout and no one's the wiser. This is NOT THE CASE at Flywheel. Your \"tech pack\" is a brightly lit display, easily visible to all from several feet away. It shows your RPM, Torque, current power output, and cumulative power output. Gone are the good ol' days when your spin instructor would tell you to \"turn the dial 75%\" to add more tension and you mimed that, while leisurely pedaling. It's been replaced by cold, hard, brightly lit numbers. Forget the other competitive aspects of the class, when I realized that the six people to my left could easily make out my \"tech pack\" numbers in the dark, I stopped sandbagging and started sweating.\n","\n","There's a second highly competitive aspect to the ride, the \"Torq Board\". During \"demo\" mode, which is what Flywheel Ballantyne is using during their Open House week, the \"Torq Board\" shows the top 20 bikes. The instructor flashes the \"Torq Board\" during a few key sprints of the session, and you can see how your power output measures up against everyone else's power output. I'm not the fittest person in the room, but when I saw that I was \"on the board\" out of 35 people, I rode harder to see how I could hold up. When you sign up for Flywheel, you can opt-in to get your name on the board to see how you measure up against others.\n","\n","The final, most unique aspect of Flywheel classes, is the 5-ish minutes of upper body work with 2 and 4lb bars that are available at each bike. At first I scoffed at this \"workout\" with such light weights, but around the 3rd to the last song, your instructor guides you to whip these out. I grabbed both (6 lbs) at the start feeling this would be easy. Soon, I dispensed of the 4lb bar in favor of just the 2lb bar. Two minutes in, I was in agony, struggling to keep proper form. Suffice to say, cycling \"aficionados\" such as myself haven't had a lot of upper body work opportunities  thrust upon them. It was enlightening how weak I was. The upper body workout toward the end is one of my favorite (or, perhaps least favorite) parts. \n","\n","I have been to two Flywheel classes, and I'm signed up for a third on Friday through their Open House week. I am planning on taking a fourth one on Sunday as well. The prices are somewhat expensive. Individual classes are $18\\/per though you can buy packs of 20 for $280, making them $14\\/per. This is still too rich for my blood, but through10\\/31, they're featuring a BOGO deal on the 5 \u0026 10 class packs, so conceivably you could get 20 classes for $150, or $7.50 per. \n","\n","It should be noted that Flywheel Sports offers a truly \"all inclusive\" experience at that high price, though. Each class includes use of a pair of cycling shoes, towel service, bottles of water and fruit, as well as access to lockers. I usually stuff these things into my gym bag before heading to the Y, but it's nice to have it all provided for you. Is it $18 per class nice? I don't know, but there you have it.\n","\n","My final word on Flywheel classes is this: The instructors know what they're doing. They are true professionals, capable of motivating you to a spin workout harder than you'd get anywhere else locally.  If you are in a rut with your local gym's spin classes, give Flywheel a try.  I used to think all spin classes were all the same. Now, I know better.\n","before Right after we moved to Charlotte, I was talking to a local in a bar about how I wanted great Mexican food. He directed me to Azteca, and told me not to worry about the fact it was connected with a Days Inn.\n","\n","That was 8 years ago, and after trying numerous Mexican restaurants in Charlotte, Azteca remains far and away our favorite. The food is delicious and the portions are huge for the price you pay. Service is always friendly and prompt. The restaurant is hopping on a Friday or Saturday night, and it's always a fun place to hang out. \n","\n","The mariachi band that plays on the weekend is a blast. On one of our last visits, they asked us if we wanted them to play us a song. We said sure, but we didn't know which one, so we suggested they play us their favorite song. They chose Elvis, which cracked us up.\n","\n","My husband loves the Arroz con Pollo. I switch around dishes, but lately my favorite is the Pork Carnitas. For $11, you get a plate with so much food on it that taking home leftovers is a must. We've had nothing but great visits to Azteca!\n","before Working under the assumption that a restaurant is only as good as its most recent reviews, I feel I need to update my previously glowing review of Blue Taj to reflect the experience I had at lunch there today.\n","\n","Unlike most local Indian restaurants, Blue Taj serves off a menu, not a buffet, for a weekday lunch. They also have some of the best Chicken Tikka Masala in town, so I stopped in today.\n","\n","I was seated by a gentleman who appeared to be the manager, and throughout my meal it was never clear who my waiter or waitress actually was. After seeing me wait for several minutes with no one coming to take my order, the manager came by and took my order.\n","\n","My food was brought out in a perfectly reasonable period of time, but the issue today was water, plain and simple. \n","\n","I'm an easy customer at Blue Taj. I know exactly what I want, and I pretty much just drink water with my meal. Keep my water glass filled, and heck - just glance over at it once in awhile to check, and I'm happy.\n","\n","The two women who were waiting on all the tables around me, couldn't be bothered to look in my direction once. Every single time I needed more water, I had to wait several minutes, try to catch someone's eye, and flag them down. It was a different person every time.\n","\n","What really sealed the deal for this one star review was when I flagged the server rushing past me without a glance after dropping off someone's check and asked her if I could have some more water.\n","\n","\"Sure, I'll get that,\" she said. And as I sat in full view of the cash register and water pitchers, I saw her walk up to the register and start talking to a friend who came into the restaurant. I don't know if my request never actually entered her mind, if it slipped her mind the first second after that, or in the 10 seconds it took her to go up and socialize with her friend and forget all about her job, but I was annoyed.\n","\n","After that failure, I had to wait for the manager, who was outside talking on his cell phone, to come back in, finally turn around after 5 minutes and glance at the tables, and flag HIM to bring me some water. It's not rocket science to keep a glass of water filled.\n","\n","After today's experience, I plan to just keep going for the buffet at Hyderabadi Biryani House down the road for lunch when my Indian food craving hits. Sure, buffet chicken tikka masala isn't as good as a freshly prepared individual dish, but at least they can keep a water glass filled.\n","before Another update on Greco Fresh Grille as they've been open now for about six months. We stopped by last Saturday around 3PM and the place was hopping. Great to see they're doing such a brisk business.\n","\n","They've added a few new items to their decor, and a few new specials to their menu. Pastitsio was listed as a special with the description of \"Greek Lasagne\" - sounded good but I was there for the gyro and fries. \n","\n","The food was great, but I wish they'd offer a combo with side items other than fries. Perhaps some hummus or a small greek salad. It's so easy to go there and get a gyro and fries, and then leave feeling like you've eaten something as heavy as 5 Guys next door.\n","\n","The owner is there every time I visit, and he stopped by to check on how things were going. This is still a winner of a place to me. It's exactly what I'd hoped for when they opened.\n","before Arrived for solo lunch around 12:45 today. After being sat in the main dining room, I watched three different servers wait on other tables and painstakingly set up cleared tables, all while studiously ignoring me for ten minutes.\n","\n","After glancing at the server setting up the four top right next to me, making eye contact and getting NOTHING in return I finally asked, \"Do I have a server?\"\n","\n","She came over a little confused, \"Oh do you want to order a drink?\" \"I'd like to order lunch,\" I replied. She took my order and left. She asked if I wanted sweetener or lemon with my iced tea and I said no thanks. She returned with my tea, with sweetener and lemon. No harm, no foul, but not very bright.\n","\n","My food came out quickly and with it my first sign of my server who apologized for the delay. After laying eyes on my mythical server and the apology I was ready to forgive and forget and just enjoy my lunch. It was good.\n","\n","The issue was that she completely disappeared again. And again the three servers who were constantly setting up tables walked right by my empty tea glass and avoided all eye contact. Finally my server showed up again and when I asked for more tea she said, \"To go?\" I was still eating!\n","\n","Just a frustratingly unprofessional experience for such a high end restaurant. I realize solo female diners are often viewed as lousy tippers but as a former server myself I tip damn well for good service. Here, I felt more ignored than anything. I won't be returning. For the same price point Ruth's Chris offers better food and service for lunch that far surpasses anything you'll get at Bernardin's.\n","before We visited Woodlands at 8PM on a Saturday night. The restaurant was completely packed with local Indian families, which I take to be an excellent sign that the food is authentic.\n","\n","Unfortunately, the wait staff seemed completely overwhelmed. It took 20 minutes for someone to even come by our table and take our orders, and another 20 minutes for our Samosas to come out of the kitchen. Once we had the Samosas, the rest of the food came out in a timely fashion, but waiting until 8:40 for our food was agonizing. I was sat with my back to the kitchen and I was so hungry that I kept looking over my shoulder, to the point that my husband said, \"Trust me honey - once it looks like our food is coming I will stand up and *applaud* there is no reason to keep looking behind you.\"\n","\n","Service and food slowness aside, our meals were excellent. I ordered the Chana Masala. My husband ordered Dal Makhani. I had reservations about visiting a vegetarian Indian restaurant, but the food was really very, very good. Woodland's won't ever be the first on my list to visit, because I prefer meat-based dishes, but if you've got a vegetarian friend who wants to eat somewhere, don't shy away from Woodlands because there's no meat on the menu.\n","\n","The service wasn't terribly friendly, which is quite different from what I'm accustomed to with my favorite Indian restaurants (my favorite places are in DC, actually). But the food was terrific.\n","\n","Woodlands was quite a haul from our Ballantyne home, but it was good to visit once to see what the fuss was all about. The food was fantastic, but with the distance, long waits to get our food and poor service, I doubt we will be back. If you're in the area and hankering for Indian food at a less busy time, I recommend visiting.\n","before I managed to snag a 6:30 reservation at McCormick and Schmick's using OpenTable last Saturday night even though it was packed. When we arrived, we found the hostess pretty much turning away anyone without a reservation.\n","\n","The hostess offered to let us sit faster in the bar area at a table, or we could wait for 15 minutes for a table outside the bar area. We opted for the bar table. For some reason, after we were sat, I received an email from OpenTable notifying me that my reservation had been \"cancelled\" by the restaurant, which was annoying because you get points for making and keeping reservations via OpenTable, which can later be redeemed for gift certificates. Because they cancelled my reservation, I didn't accrue those points.\n","\n","That issue aside, our server was Susan, and she was fast and helpful. The food came out quickly, as expected since they had a fairly set Restaurant Week menu. My crab cakes were excellent, but my husband reported that his scallops were cold.\n","\n","The service (and my crab cakes) are what jack this review up to 3 stars. They got it about half right. I can't say that I'd definitely return.\n","before Spent a rainy Saturday afternoon shopping and decided to hit Harper's for lunch. They were slammed so there was a brief wait before we were seated. \n","\n","The service was impressive. I'm pretty sure the waiter thought I was going to be high maintenance because as soon as he brought my Diet Coke in a short tumbler I stopped him before he left and said, \"Just so you know, I drink like a fish. Do you have any larger glasses to save you some trips?\" He said they didn't, but that he'd bring me two smaller glasses at a time. He kept up with me and the litter of tumblers that accrued over the course of our meal. I can't imagine though, why they insist on serving sodas in tiny little tumbler glasses.\n","\n","The food was good. I ordered the chopped chef salad with chicken. The menu said it came with avocado, but it did not. Still, it was quite tasty.\n","\n","The bill for 1 beer, my soda, 1 app and 2 dinner salads came out to roughly $45. Decent, although a little pricey for lunch. Good restaurant, we'll visit again I'm sure.\n","before We were in the neighborhood and my husband hit Yelp to try to find a good place for lunch. Las Margaritas' 4 and 5 star reviews stood out. It was Cinco de Mayo, and Mexican seemed like an ideal choice.\n","\n","The menu is good, and the lunch specials are available even on weekends. We each ordered one of the lunch specials for $5-$6. My husband ordered the Arroz con Pollo (his standard) and I tried a dish new to me... \"Chilaquile\" or something like that. I was in it for the tomatillo sauce. Kind of like an open faced burrito with corn tortillas.\n","\n","The beer was cold. The salsa (both a veggie based slaw-type salsa and a regular thin medium tomato-based salsa) was good. The chips were fresh and warm. Our food was excellent, and portion sizes were generous for the prices we paid at lunchtime. Service was fantastic and a great soccer game was on the telly.\n","\n","For me, a 5-star rating means there's nothing I can find fault with or suggest improvement upon. Las Margaritas is a humble strip mall Mexican restaurant that serves delicious food at great prices and with attentive service. For what it is, I can suggest nothing at all to improve upon. If we're ever in the neighborhood, we'll be back!\n","before Stopped by for a late lunch today. Other reviews are spot on about the process. Service was a little slow, but they were all still quite nice. The place looks clean, and the food was good. Watch how others pack their bowl and do the same. To me, the restaurant felt like a \"do it yourself\" buffet-style version of Pei-Wei. I definitely liked the food.\n","\n","Some reviews caution about spiciness, but even trying for med-hot my dish wasn't very spicy. You can ask for Sriracha once you get your bowl, though, so that got the heat I was after. \n","\n","My waitress offered me a to-go cup for my just-refilled soda right as I was about to leave, which I thought was a nice touch. I'll definitely be back\n","before I'm new to working Uptown 5 days a week in the south\\/Wells Fargo\\/Duke Energy\\/Ally area. Coworker took me here today, and I was duly impressed!\n","\n","The line gets long, but moves quickly. Tables were always available, but just barely, around the noon lunch hour. They do a lot of carry out business.\n","\n","The food was a very, VERY tall step above what you get at Tintin, up north where BofA offices are located. If you dine-in, your meal is served on a nice plate with real silverware and sauce.\n","\n","For lunch I got the steak and broccoli, substituting onions \u0026 zucchini for sweet carrots (.50 cents) and a soda.\n","\n","The food arrived quickly and was delicious! It was honestly like eating at a Benihana without the drama of a table show. The steak was perfectly cooked, the meal was tasty and filling, and it was the best amount of food to avoid a full-on afternoon food coma. Great value for the money spent!\n","\n","Added bonus: Huy Fong Sriracha at the table!\n","\n","It was so delicious, I plan on going tomorrow for my weekly lunch with my husband! This is a gem. I foresee many more lunches spent here.\n","before Visited Fuji last night with my in-laws, including my sister-in-law who was in town with my young niece and nephew. I have actually been a waitress at this type of hibachi steakhouse before, back in college, so I knew exactly what to expect, and Fuji definitely met my expectations.\n","\n","We all did the hibachi grill menu for the show, which finally got the kids' attention away from their Leapfrog and iTouch and onto the chef. They were mesmerized by all the elements of the cooking. I made it a point to ask for the \"kids chopsticks\" which are a chopstick set that's got rubber bands and a \"fulcrum\" made from the chopstick wrapping paper so that kids can use it to eat their food without having to have as much dexterity as an adult. The only thing I could suggest is that maybe these could be offered to any table with youngsters eating without someone having to ask? I only knew these existed because I had made them many times in my job, and everyone at the table was surprised and happy when the kids got their own set of usable chopsticks. We made a big deal out of them using their \"chopsticks\" and in doing so actually got the picky eaters to eat more than they might have otherwise.\n","\n","The menu is the usual basic hibachi experience: miso soup, salad with ginger dressing (ranch is also available), a shrimp \"appetizer\", vegetables, rice and meat. This restaurant also had noodles that they cooked which were delicious. I've never really been a fan of noodles in Asian cuisine (or anywhere in general) but I ate all of mine quickly.\n","\n","The service was quick, the food was good, the \"show\" was good, and we had a great time. I should note that Sunday night at 6:30 is a great time to bring kids as the two in our party were able to make a little bit of their usual noise, but were drowned out by the sounds of the fan, and there was at least one child of their age or younger at each of the other tables, so I wasn't terribly worried about noise or inconveniencing other patrons.\n","\n","Fuji didn't stand out particularly for any one thing, but they delivered a solid meal for all of us quickly. We'll be back!\n","before I visited the Dowd YMCA for the first time last night for a workout and a session in their steam room. Normally I'm a regular at the south Charlotte Y's (Morrison, Harris \u0026 Siskey) but since it's a new year, I figured I'd try my hand at visiting this Y after work, since it's only about 1.5 miles from my office. The reviews here helped to convince me to give it a try, so I figured I'd write my own review as well to add to the information.\n","\n","I showed up around 4:45 and managed to find a spot. As soon as I walked through the turnstile I went to the guest relations desk and asked the woman behind the counter if she could direct me to the women's locker rooms. She offered right there to give me a full tour, so I took her up on the offer.\n","\n","The facility is large, and as others have remarked, bustling. There were multiple basketball courts, two sets of lap lanes in the swimming pool (one warm, one cold), and all the other features you'd expect at a gym: spin room, tons of cardio machines just about everywhere you turned, machined weights and free weights. They had several stretch assisting machines and devices throughout the main gym area as well.\n","\n","The women's locker room is indeed huge, and it's overwhelming at first. Lockers abound (I think there are almost too many, there's no way these fill up at 100%). I only found two toilet stalls in the women's locker room, but I'm pretty sure I must have missed another set somewhere. \n","\n","One thing to note: You need a full-sized padlock for these lockers. I have used a small luggage style combo lock at the Harris for a long time, but it doesn't fit the lockers at the Dowd. Fortunately, they'll let you borrow a keyed lock with a driver's license.\n","\n","There are a limited number of machines (perhaps a dozen or two, treadmills, ellipticals, stair steppers, recumbent bikes and rowing machines) and free weights in the women's locker room, and most of them were in use. I opted to climb onto one of the stair stepping machines for 20 minutes to start. After that I wandered the rest of the gym and hopped on a treadmill for a few more minutes. The stair stepper action (it's been awhile since I've used a stair stepper) caused my calf to tighten up uncomfortably, so I only spent another 20 minutes on the treadmill. It's January and as you can imagine, the place is packed to the gills.\n","\n","I decided to ease off and hit the steam room, which let's face it, is the real reason I go to the Y (well, this one and Harris, at least). I just force myself to exercise before I get to the \"reward\".\n","\n","And this is where the Dowd Y fell short for me. The steam room was the driest steam room I've used, and the full, bright lighting made it  less relaxing than the one at the Harris. It's not serene and quiet, people chat and talk loudly in this steam room. \n","\n","Both the Dowd \u0026 the Harris Y have spray bottles of eucalyptus from a \"Club Aroma\" spa supply place. The eucalyptus bottle at the Harris Y is occasionally running on empty, but when it's filled it is good stuff. The \"eucalyptus\" at the Dowd was non-existent. They're cutting it so much with water (I presume) that it smells like nothing. The eucalyptus not only helps with opening nasal passages, it also makes the steam rooms smell nice, and this one - since there's no real eucalyptus to spray - smelled decidedly NOT nice.\n","\n","Finally, there's something else others have touched on a bit: the rampant nudity in the locker rooms. Here's the thing - I'm a bit of a prude about nakedness, being as I was raised in the south and taught the naked human form was an evil tool of the devil and all. But in a locker room, I realize that's mostly MY problem, and that the occasional flash of full frontal or a butt is the price you pay for dressing and undressing around other women. \n","\n","There's a difference between flashes of nudity, and the women walking around the Dowd Y locker room for two hours, acting like they're in a nudist colony. Seriously, not a stitch on one particular older woman for two hours, as she stretched, dried her hair, lounged in chairs, and rubbed lotion on her face. I'm real glad for her that she's comfortable with the body she's got, but *I'M* not comfortable with it, and seeing her with her legs kicked up on the chair outside the steam room every time I entered it, just letting it all hang out, was disturbing. And it's not just about looks, I don't care how aesthetically pleasing your naked form might be, at least show a little courtesy and a slight amount of modesty.\n","\n","I didn't find the steam room or the locker room relaxing after my workout at all last night. I saw things no human should have to see, frankly. I appreciate it's close to my office, but I've heard Childress-Klein is too, and a little better about these sorts of things. I'd recommend the Dowd Y, but only to people who really honestly don't care about having strange women exhibitionists waving stuff around in their faces while in the locker room. As for me - I care - probably too much to return.\n","before Tried Golden China yesterday based on the reviews here on Yelp. Ordered for dine-in up front and chose Mongolian Beef. The food came out quickly, and it was good food and plentiful, but not quite as savory or flavorful as I've had at other restaurants. The kitchen was busy and the restaurant was full of workers taking their lunch hour. \n","\n","The dining area was clean, but also very sparse. Dine-in orders are served with a small plastic fork and there are packets of duck sauce and spicy mustard on the tables, as well as a small bottle of soy sauce.\n","\n","The only concern I had was the kitchen. It's an open kitchen and they have a ServSafe certificate hanging up, but I couldn't locate the sanitation rating, and being as its in SC, they're pretty generic about their scores anyway. \n","\n","I witnessed the two women running the phones and cash register also handling raw chicken and eggrolls without any gloves. They were dumping these items into the fryer as fast as they could, so my concern wasn't so much about the food being contaminated by their hands that had touched the cash register, phones, etc. as I was about my credit card being handled by someone who had just handled food bare-handed. I've seen worse in some restaurants, but it was still concerning to witness it right in front of me in an open kitchen.\n","before Made a reservation for 7:30 via OT, which is something I've become addicted to lately. Upon our arrival we were given a coaster\\/beeper and went to the bar. Our table was ready in less than 10 minutes.\n","\n","We were sat at the table just outside the kitchen, which is a pretty ideal place to be. Not only could I read the specials (and prices) on the whiteboard in the kitchen, but our server was always around in case we needed to flag her down.\n","\n","The mascarpone goat cheese appetizer was... \"meh\". I encouraged my husband to order it after reading all the rave reviews here. Here's the thing, I hate the \"mustiness\" of goat cheese. I figured that perhaps the mascarpone cut that flavor, and that everyone was raving over it because it tasted better than I remembered goat cheese tasting. It really didn't. I wasn't thrilled.\n","\n","My husband got the penne with tomato vodka sauce and some turkey meatballs. I got \"Joe's\" pizza. Both were very good, and even better the next day as leftovers. Frankly, I was sincerely hoping for a butternut squash pasta special but sadly, that was not to be. Probably only comes up in the fall...\n","\n","We'll be back. This place is every carb-loader's dream. (Heard the table behind me ordering pasta in preparation for the next day's Corporate Cup half marathon, and we went there for my husband to carb load before his long ride... So if you need carbs, go here!)\n","before Thought that a simple blunt cut and bang trim wouldn't be too hard for a Great Clips stylist, but I was wrong.\n","\n","Tara at Great Clips butchered my hair completely. After telling her I'd like my bangs trimmed to \"at or just below my eyebrows\" she misted my bangs and then yanked them down, PULLING on them while wet and slicing them off in one motion, right at eyebrow level. The result? Well, since hair stretches so much when it's wet, my bangs are a short fringe over an INCH above my eyebrows. \n","\n","You know, I learned my lesson about pulling on wet hair and cutting it when I cut my own bangs for the first time at the age of TWELVE. Yes, she cut my hair as bad as a sixth grader. I can't believe that a \"hair stylist\" doesn't know this. Perhaps a better title for her would be \"hair butcher\".\n","\n","It's a month of wearing headbands for me, thanks to the hatchet job Tara did on my hair. Word of warning: Run, do not walk, away from this Great Clips. Think they can handle a simple haircut? They can't...\n","before If you were thinking of going to Cantina 1511 for Queens Feast 2013, stop thinking and just GO! Their menu includes four courses, and half price bottles of wine. How can you go wrong?\n","\n","We went last night, for the first night of QF 2013 and had a blast. Our waiter, Javier, was attentive and really wonderful. If we go back, we'll ask for him again.\n","\n","The food was amazing. For the first course, they serve you guacamole with your chips. For two people, you get a smaller bowl of guacamole than they usually make tableside, and it was really just mixed together at the table, not anything else. At first I was hoping for more, but I was only able to eat about a third of my entree by the time it arrived so really, the amount ended up being more than either of us needed.\n","\n","I ordered the jicama and avocado salad for my 2nd course. It was HUGE! My husband ordered one of the soups which was also a generous portion. By the time my main arrived, the non-vegetarian enchilada dish, I was already nearing full. I ate a respectable third, but needed the rest to go in order to enjoy the Bananas Foster chimichanga they served along with ice cream at the end.\n","\n","For wine, we had a bottle of the Pinot at $13, I think it was. For our normal dining out experience, it was a tad pricey (we normally don't eat anything but a main, maybe $15 per person) but for a Queen's Feast splurge the meal was generous and delicious, and the service was great.\n","\n","Be sure to make a reservation, though! The place was packed.\n","before My husband and I visited Rooster's in South Park for the first time on Saturday night.\n","\n","My first impressions of the restaurant were excellent. We had made a reservation via OpenTable, and upon arriving for our 7:30 reservation at 7:25PM, the hostess took one glance at her terminal after asking my name and said, \"Your table is waiting, follow me.\" That's what I want to hear.\n","\n","Once we were sat, however, it was a full 10 minutes before our server came to our table. After such a prompt seating by a hostess who conveyed gravitas and professionalism (she wasn't some college kid, which impressed me greatly) I was expecting promptness and seasoned professionalism throughout the place. \n","\n","Our waiter finally showed up, and didn't ask if we wanted to know the specials, or have any information for us. Instead, when I asked him about the beers on draft, he informed me that no beers were on draft (which is fine) and disappeared for another five minutes to get us a beer menu. \n","\n","He placed it with us, then left again, then returned to ask us if we had decided on drinks. We had, so we ordered them, and again he was off - with no inquiry about if we had any questions on the menu, and no offer to take our order. Yeah, I was hungry. Got a problem with that?\n","\n","We finally got bread, and water, which I had trouble getting refilled. I also drink a lot, and drink fast (which yes, caused me problems in my college days). I found that water-filling staff members would  come and fill the water glasses of the newly-seated tables around us, without a single look at my empty water glass. Finally, I stopped one woman going to the table next to me and asked with my eyes and a nudge if she could spare some more water. \n","\n","Our orders were eventually placed and the food was good - very good. But the portions were small. The three stars are for the food, to be sure. My husband ordered the lamb chop special, which he very much enjoyed. He particularly enjoyed the mint sauce that came with it.\n","\n","I ordered the hangar steak, cooked medium, and the pan fried corn. I received hangar steak, cooked rare. Fortunately, I can enjoy steak cooked along the spectrum from rare to medium well, so I didn't send it back. Besides, I had waited long enough for my food, I wasn't about to let my server take it back so he could have them re-cook it and risk the spit. So yeah, when he checked in I smiled broadly and said, \"Everything is great!\" as I ate my steak that mooed. The corn was good, but nothing I couldn't easily recreate in a cast iron skillet at home with a few ears of fresh corn and some butter.\n","\n","This restaurant visit was a part of our \"date night\" so my husband and I enjoyed  the evening. The next day, my husband confessed to me that he was expecting more from a \"wood-fired kitchen\" - like, stuff that actually tasted like it had been cooked over a wood fire. Neither of our entrees had any smokiness to them. He had been itching to go to Firebirds, but we chose Rooster's instead because it was \"new\". Firebirds delivered more on the smoke when we last visited there.\n","\n","We likely won't be going back to Rooster's for date-night in the future. The food was okay, but didn't wow me. The ambiance was \"meh\". The gem of the night was that fantastic professional hostess. I wish Noble could channel that excellence into the rest of the experience at Roosters.\n","before We visited Libretto's Pizzeria in Ballantyne last night, after a torrential downpour. It was relatively empty even though it was a Saturday night, due to the weather.\n","\n","The restaurant is smaller than it looked like it would be from the outside. It has faux brick walls and rustic wrought iron accents. There are at least 5 large televisions in the relatively small bar area. We opted to sit at the bar, as the hostess informed us the back dining room was a little loud.\n","\n","Service was unimpressive. After 5-10 minutes of waiting, we caught a waiter's eye. He came over and asked us if we'd been helped. When we said no, he seemed taken aback, but decided to take our food and drink orders anyway, and he was our waiter for the night. When I ordered Miller Lite, assuming I'd get draft since it was clearly on the tap, I was surprised to receive it in a bottle. He explained that it was on special in the bottle, which was great. Just wish he'd mentioned that earlier.\n","\n","When my husband needed a drink refill, our waiter was either nowhere to be found or actively ignoring us. (He had perfected the \"ignore everything but what's directly in my line of sight\" walk throughout the restaurant.) Someone who appeared to be a manager paced all around us, but his eyes were so glued to the Panther's game on the television that there was no way to get his attention without shouting at him or physically going up to him. After waiting so long for a refill that he had almost finished his meal, my husband finally decided to go directly to the bar for his refill. When the bartender informed our waiter, he didn't seem terribly pleased with us, but it was a relatively empty restaurant, and trying to flag down someone - anyone - for ten minutes for a refill was unacceptable.\n","\n","The pizza (San Gennaro) was good, but didn't stand out. We ordered a Medium which was ample sized for 2. The Bruschetta \"3 ways\"? Not so good. The classic tomatoes\\/onions bruschetta topping had pale tomatoes. Not a sin in December, but it's August. The olive tapenade was good, but the bean puree was underseasoned and bland. \n","\n","We had a nice evening out at Libretto's, but the food was pretty forgettable and the service was sub-par. I'm pretty sure we won't be back. There are too many other good pizza options in this area of Charlotte.\n","before I've been to D'Vine wine many times since they opened in Ballantyne Village. Most recently, my husband and I wrapped up a \"date night\" with drinks and dessert at D'Vine this past Saturday.\n","\n","The GREAT: They had a hostess at the door, with an eagle eye for the available seats in the establishment. Our original thought was to cozy up to the bar (my favorite place there) with a couple of seats to enjoy a glass of wine and some dessert. She informed us there might be seats in the back we'd enjoy, or we could wait for a table to open. Sitting at a table wasn't really what I was envisioning, but I was open to her showing us the space in the back. It was detached (both seats weren't facing each other, which she'd warned us about) so we elected to take up the one seat at the bar (for me, hubby is such a chivalrous fellow :) and within 2 minutes another seat opened up. I really appreciated her work and attempt to find us a good place to be in the restaurant. It's the first time we were greeted by a \"hostess\" there.\n","\n","The wine is, as always, excellent. I love that they carry Trefethen, my sentimental favorite for reasons I won't bore you with here. (They are awesome, that is all you need to know.) \n","\n","The desserts were disappointing. The chocolate bread pudding was not nearly chocolate-y enough (allspice shouldn't be the predominant flavor of a dish advertised as \"chocolate\" in my opinion) and the apple pie-style dessert was, in a word, measly.\n","\n","In general, I like D'Vine for the wine but not so much for the food. We did a Supertasting this past fall that was supposed to feature the flavors of Thanksgiving, but the food was terrible.\n"," \n","My advice: Enjoy what  D'Vine brings to the table for wine, but not for food.\n","before I've been a loyal customer at Aloha Nails for the past five years. Over that time, I've been in probably 100+ times to have my \"solar nails\" (aka pink \u0026 white, aka acrylics, etc. nails) put on, taken off, or maintained.\n","\n","Today, I'm finally dropping my review from 5 stars to 2 stars. The sole reason? I can't go between visits without these weak nails breaking completely, several times over. \n","\n","When I first started going to Aloha Nails, I was also training for a century ride, as a cyclist. I was impressed so much the first time I was pumping up a tire and the inflating hose blew off, slamming me in my hand. My nails didn't suffer so much as a crack!\n","\n","But for the last four months, I'm finding that 2-3 weeks in between visits isn't enough for me to keep these false nails in even DECENT shape. Since December, I had about four major nail breaks. When I go in to get my nails redone\\/repaired, fixing the breaks is often painful, with them wedging the gel\\/material off my nailbed using another sharp-edged artificial nail. Now, I've had artificial nails for months on end, and what I can tell you is that the nailbed under the artificial nail is EXCEPTIONALLY sensitive!\n","\n","So, basically, every visit has featured some amount of pain since December.\n","\n","This last visit, I found that my pinky nail just flew off while I was closing a car door. Not even hard! I visited today and the woman re-did my nails, cutting off the length. I saw a crack on my right thumbnail and figured she'd repair it before letting me leave.\n","\n","She finished her work, and I left. And now here I am 3 hours later with a chipped thumbnail because she didn't bother to repair the nail!\n","\n","My nutrition and body hasn't changed wildly since December, but nails from here are cracking and falling apart right and left. I don't know what they've done differently, but I'm seriously considering a new nail salon for my next visit. Very disappointed.\n","\n","EDIT\\/UPDATE: I received a very kind note from one of the owners of Aloha nails asking me to return so they could take a look at my nails and figure out what was making them break so easily. I appreciate the note, and have added another star because they DO care about their customers being happy, but I've chosen to return to my natural nails after this series of breaks.\n","before Tried out this new and already very popular restaurant last Friday. We went in early-ish  (6 to me is early) and found the place packed. We got the last seats in the house before they went on a wait.\n","\n","As others have noted, there are a lot of tall tops, but we sat at one of the few tables behind the wall at the entrance. I will agree that any of us who find we carry weight in our hips\\/thighs could find these seats pretty uncomfortable. I was good to go, thankfully, but I can see where if I were up just another size or two it would be painful, and that would be embarrassing. I wonder how long they'll keep those chairs.\n","\n","Our server was incredibly attentive, professional and helpful. Five stars for service. I didn't see anyone wanting\\/waiting for anything while we were there.\n","\n","The food was okay. Not fantastic, but it's a bar essentially, so you get decent quality bar food. As it was still Happy Hour we ordered half price appetizers - chips and salsa and hummus. The chips and salsa were just sad. A tiny cup of salsa, and a handful or so of chips on a plate. Not worth the money, even at half price, certainly nothing special. The hummus was delicious and served with pita, carrots and celery.\n","\n","My husband ordered the steak tips, and was disappointed by the blandness of the rice. It would be better served with mashed potatoes rather than just a formed mound of white rice with no flavor. (I don't like rice, to me it has no flavor anyway, but my husband fixes and devours a lot of it and even he pronounced it \"incredibly bland\" as he reached for the salt shaker.) \n","\n","Oh, a word about the shakers... Pour the salt in your hands first. They have a ton of holes and you'll get a bucket of salt dumped on your meal if you just shake from it.\n","\n","I tried the fish sandwich and pretty much just ate it like fish and chips, because it was less food and cheaper than the fish and chips and I didn't have a huge appetite after the appetizers. My meal was solid.\n","\n","The biggest problem we have with this restaurant is visiting during the heat of the summer. It was 85+ degrees outside, and with that awesome cool garage door set up opened, it was very hot and stuffy inside. There were no fans anywhere near our tables. I saw one small set of fans over the bar area, but that's it. \n","\n","Here in Charlotte, in the summer, you can either go for cool air conditioning or sweltering \"ambiance\" you can't have both. They need to keep that door closed and the restaurant air conditioned in the summer.\n","\n","It sounds like I hate this place. Really, I don't. The restaurant is new, but it has great potential. Clearly they hired good servers, and they're trying this whole menu for the first time so I'm sure there will be changes.\n","\n","We will be back to BSH sometime, but with those garage doors and the heat issues inside the restaurant, we probably won't return until the fall.\n","before I'm writing an updated review for Hyderabadi Biryani House to reflect my experience ordering off-menu, rather than just the buffet. For a full review on the buffet, read my earlier 4-star review.\n","\n","I mentioned in my earlier review that I felt like the buffet version of Hyderabadi Biryani House's dishes were a little more bland than I'd like, and that's true as they are catering the buffet to a wide range of tastes.\n","\n","I decided to try ordering takeout from Hyderabadi Biryani House for the first time just a few weeks ago, and it was FANTASTIC and perfectly spiced! I ordered Chicken Tikka Masala and Chicken Korma, medium-spicy, and both dishes were incredibly flavorful and delicious, rivaling the more upscale (and pricey) Blue Taj in quality.\n","\n","I also ordered Samosas, just one serving, and was delighted to find they provide three full-sized Samosas in one order, instead of the two I was expecting.\n","\n","While their Samosa quantity for one order is overly generous, one order of naan is one single flatbread, so if two of you are dining out, be sure to place one order of naan per person if you're into naan as much as I am.\n","\n","The takeout portions of the main dishes exactly werewhat I expected, if not just a little generous, while the rice portion for 2 was just a little less than we ended up needing. It was easy enough to make some additional rice for my leftover meal.\n","\n","Which brings me to another great thing about the portions provided for takeout: If I eat judiciously, there's usually enough for me to bring for lunch the next day, especially if we get an order of Samosas! I love that I can get 2 meals out of one order.\n","\n","I've tried most Indian restaurants in the area, and Hyderabadi Biryani House is my favorite. Their prices are the most reasonable, and their food and portions are the best. I highly, HIGHLY recommend this restaurant, for either the buffet, or for carryout\\/dine-in!\n","before A small group of us headed out for lunch today, and upon getting to our preferred restaurant, Basil, found they had a 30 minute wait to be seated. 5Church didn't have a wait, so we figured we would try eating there instead, since several of us had meetings after lunch. In retrospect, the lack of a wait should have been a clue.\n","\n","We were sat immediately, and the server took our orders fairly quickly. The lunch menu is slim: sandwiches, flat breads and salads. Honestly, nothing that can't be thrown together with 5 minutes of time and a fryolator. One person ordered a salad, the rest of us ordered sandwiches, which according to the posterboard outside, came with fries and a drink for $10. (Our server never inquired if we wanted drinks, by the way. You got water only unless you asked for a drink specifically.)\n","\n","Our orders were taken around 12:15. At 12:50, after seeing several tables that had been sat after us receive their orders, I finally inquired when we saw our server, who had been MIA for a long while, with runners delivering to his one or two tables. (One table sat down after us, got their meal, and left, before we even got our meal.)\n","\n","My inquiry was far more polite than the curses some members of our table had lobbed into our discussion about the restaurant and our MIA server in particular after seeing everyone BUT US served in the 30+ minutes we had to wait for our pedestrian, easily-assembled sandwiches and fries.\n","\n","Frankly, I couldn't blame my tablemates, many of whom had better places to be than sitting idly at the table of a missing-in-action incompetent server in an inefficient restaurant. Honestly, I was the least pissed off of all the diners, so I was the one to ask about our food, in the most polite, non-assertive manner I could muster - because to do so otherwise would invite spit from this type of place and our \"Hack\" server. Unlike half of my tablemates, I didn't have somewhere else to be an hour after I left for lunch (i.e @1:00).\n","\n","My exact words when our MIA server finally decided to grace us with his presence were, \"Hi, can you check on our order? Several of us have meetings we need to get to in a few minutes.\" \n","\n","As soon as the words left my mouth, our aptly-named server \"Hack\" (according to my receipt) seemed deeply offended that we had the damned AUDACITY to inquire about food that took way too long for a business lunch. \n","\n","Our server \"Hack\" stiffened and adopted a defensive and rude demeanor. \"As you can see, we're very busy!\" he huffed pompously. \n","\n","Seriously?! Drop the attitude, sweetheart. You don't work at e2e or Blue and only one other table has been sat in your area in the last 30 minutes. Sorry, but 5Church isn't on par with Charlotte's classy or high volume restaurants like say, Basil, which actually had a wait - and clearly for a good reason. \n","\n","\"Your food is coming out soon!\" he snapped nastily, as he trounced off.\n","\n","Our food finally arrived about 5 minutes later, and soon after that a soda glass was wordlessly slammed down next to me, presumably to replace my drink that had been emptied while our waiter had been MIA for so long.We asked for our checks, which arrived after about ten minutes. Hardly prompt, but it was better than I expected from our \"Hack\" server.\n","\n","The food was okay. The fries were overdone, but my sandwich was okay. We scarfed down our food and got out of there as quickly as possible. 5Church had way overstayed its welcome for those of us who had other things to do.\n","\n","I'd seriously recommend you avoid 5Church during the day if you have any other plans after your lunch, or if you want a professional server. The food was okay but the unprofessional service was galling. \"Hack\" was a certainly an appropriate name for our server. We won't return. This location doesn't seem to ever hold a successful restaurant, and with this kind of service, 5Church seems to be yet another failure just working its way on through.\n","before We made reservations for Georges Brasserie for Queen's Feast weekend. It's the only restaurant we've chosen so far this time around. \n","\n","I was surprised to receive a phone call two days before our dinner to confirm our reservation. The caller asked me if I had an indoor\\/outdoor seating preference, and reminded me that Queen's Feast was going on. Calling to confirm was a nice touch, just like reservations used to be way back in the good ol' days.\n","\n","We were seated as soon as we arrived. Doug was our server, and he did a fantastic job. We brought a special wine from our cellar, which Doug uncorked and served to us. ($15 corkage fee.)  The service was absolutely perfect, from beginning to end.\n","\n","More amazing than the splendid service, however, was the food. My husband ordered the mussels. I can't eat or try mussels because I have developed an allergy, so I can't say firsthand how they tasted, or even how the broth tasted. What I CAN say is that I've never seen my husband so happy about his food. I asked him if I needed to leave him and the mussels alone for a moment. My husband said, and I quote, \"I have not had anything better since I had that escargot in Beaune, France.\" Now, you need to realize he puts that dinner in Beaune up on a pedestal. That's his baseline for ultimate perfection. So to put the mussels in that category was the highest compliment he's paid any restaurant in Charlotte, ever.\n","\n","I had the Vichyssoise myself, and I loved it. I may not have had the affair with my first course that my husband had with his, but it was damned good. The best I've had in the area as well.\n","\n","Our main courses were solid, but not as surprisingly awesome as the first course. My husband had the short ribs, which he liked, but said were on par with other places in town. I had the chicken (I know, I'm so BORING!) which I ordered  primarily because I was interested in the black garlic buerre blanc. It was delicious and I really enjoyed it.\n","\n","We both agreed on flourless chocolate cakes for our dessert. Again with the ooh-ing and the aah-ing. My husband and I both agreed it was the best, and probably most rich, flourless chocolate cake we'd ever had. Perfectly moist, almost like a mousse, and very delicious. I appreciated that the raspberry coulis was an accent on the plate and not on the cake, as I don't like raspberries very much.\n","\n","Based on that one meal, we will certainly be back for lunches and dinners. Georges Brasserie was hands-down, the nicest meal I've ever had for Charlotte Restaurant week. You have another week to get there, so make your reservations. It's the best!\n","before 521 has been around for several years, and now that the area around it is more developed, they've added a nice outdoor patio. I love 521 BBQ's pulled pork. It has a mildly smoky flavor, and you get the brown crusty parts of the pork too. \n","\n","The ambiance at 521 isn't much to write home about, but I love to drop in to pick up a couple of pounds of pulled pork to go. It's about $10\\/lb hot, but if you're willing to take it home and reheat it, they'll sell you the remnants of yesterday's pork, already refrigerated, for about $6 which is a much better deal. I pick up that, a thing of their vinegar based sauce, and I'm good for a week! Love the stuff. It's not the absolute best I've ever eaten, but it's pretty high up there!\n","before My husband and I made appointments for oil changes for both of our cars at Goodyear on Sunday. His appointment was at 1, and mine was at 2. I showed up with my car at 2PM and my husband was still waiting for them to finish up with his car. We sat together in the waiting area, and within 20 minutes my car was pulled around and my maintenance was done.\n","\n","We asked when my husband's car would be ready and were told \"in just a few minutes\". We waited, and waited, and waited some more. No one could tell us what the delay was. Finally, at 2:45, after waiting an hour and 45 minutes, I pointedly asked what was taking so long. They couldn't tell us. Several customers had come and gone in the time it took us to wait for my husband's car.\n","\n","At 2:55, after a nearly two hour wait, they FINALLY took my husband's car down and brought it around. When he inquired (again!) as to why it took so long they said they had issues with a latch on his battery (he'd asked them to check that, since there was a loose connector issue).  \n","\n","They gave us $20 off his service for the extended wait, which we appreciated for the time we had to wait, but they should have communicated with us about what was taking so long. My husband had only asked them to check the battery latch because he thought it would be just a quick thing, had we known it would take so long, we would have told them not to bother with it.\n","before Hell, I'll go ahead and give Riccio's five stars, even though we had to wait awhile for our food! Read on to find out why.\n","\n","Visited Riccio's this past Friday night. Arrived at 6:45 and were seated by 7. Ordered 2 pasta dishes, lasagne and manicotti, as well as some garlic knots. Prices seemed very good. Restaurant ambiance was nice. Wait staff was quite friendly.\n","\n","The only issue was that our food took roughly 45 minutes to come out.\n","\n","In that time though, our waitress took care of us. She dropped another 6 garlic knots off at our table, when she saw things were going long. We ordered another round of beers just before our food came. We'd been hoping to just have one beer with dinner but when you're waiting for 45 minutes, you get thirsty.\n","\n","Our food finally did come, and I went from peeved to purely thrilled. The tomato sauce is different from anything I've ever tasted and the cheese on the top of the manicotti was crisped in such a way that it was nearly a light crust. I ate every single bite, even though I had eaten far too many garlic knots before it arrived. My meal was unreal. Was it \"Italian Authentic\"? I don't know. I've been to Italy three times and have never had manicotti that tasted this delicious so maybe it's not \"authentic\" but it's what I loved. That's all that mattered.\n","\n","When we got our check I was kind of surprised at the cost. Surprised in that it was less than I had expected. Not only had our waitress comped our second round of garlic knots, she also comped our second round of beers because she had to wait longer than usual.\n","\n","It's unusual you find a \"long standing tradition\" kind of place that's \"family run\" but is also this friendly and this generous. Riccio's is all of that, and to top it off the food is phenomenal - easily the best in Charlotte. The waitress explained that our long wait was an aberration due to a whole flurry of pizzas that took up the oven right before we ordered. I don't think it's a common problem, and I can't complain after all they did for us. We will be back.\n","before Gave this a try based on other Yelp reviews. You know how you read about a restaurant with mixed reviews, and you just hope that the reviewers with the bad reviews were really picky? Yeah, that's what I was hoping.\n","\n","I'm here to say that the reviews weren't wrong; service is definitely lacking at La Catrina, and one of the reasons we likely won't return.\n","\n","When we arrived around 6 for dinner, there were multiple tables on the right side of the restaurant shoved together, with a bunch of kids and adults who looked to have recently been to a swim meet. There were several booths in the area with kids and adults too. \n","\n","The person seating my husband and I bypassed several empty tables on the left side of the restaurant, and tried to seat us at a booth in between and right in the middle of all the kids and adults.\n","\n","I've got nothing against kids, but why would you sit two adults who are just hoping to have a nice meal in the very center of tables with mostly kids when there are so many other tables available?\n","\n","I asked that we move to a different area, so instead of putting us somewhere quieter, he just moved us to a booth on the other side of the same section. Noise level was pretty intense until the large groups left.\n","\n","We tried to order beers on draft, but were informed draft beer was not available for some reason. So we ordered two bottled beers. It took 10+ minutes for us to get our beers. I was in full sight of the bar so I watched as our waiter didn't even try going to the bar to get our beers until roughly the 10 minute mark. \n","\n","When our beers were finally brought, my husband had been given the wrong one. The waiter was pouring out of the bottles into the glasses and my husband had to ask him to remove his hand from the label so he could confirm which beer it was. He'd ordered a darker beer and noticed the beer being poured was more of a light ale\\/lager style.\n","\n","Our food wasn't memorable, but it was okay. Salsa was really watered down and runny.\n","\n","There are so many better Mexican restaurants within a 5 minute drive, that I just can't imagine why we would ever return here again.\n","before Writing a review of All Paws presents a real dilemma to me. I looked forward to the shop opening, as it was replacing a failing business in the shopping center. When it opened initially as All Wags - there has now been a falling out with the owners of All Wags and they've started operating this store independently - I visited, got to know the people working there and pledged to come back often for purchases.\n","\n","Unfortunately, I can't do that anymore because All Paws simply won't order the cat food that I need. The first few times I was in, they carried Acana Grasslands, although it was in a small bag. I asked them to order the 15# bag and picked it up once it came in stock. They stock the Acana line, but they don't seem to carry the large bag of Acana Grasslands. My cats have digestive issues, so switching their food is not an option. I have told them many times that they have a guaranteed purchase from me, once a month, of this product - if they will only order it.\n","\n","My frustration really has begun in the last month, as I've gone in and asked them to order Acana Grasslands 15# cat food three times. Each time they say they'll do it, but the call never comes. The second time I went in I was sure they must have ordered it (it had been two weeks since I'd stopped by to ask) and they still had not ordered it. I was promised it would be ordered \"in the next week\". I heard the same story again on my third visit to check if they had ordered my food. I don't understand how they can stock Acana, but can't order this flavor for me. Meanwhile, if I had waited on them to order the food, my cats would have starved by now.\n","\n","With no other options, I finally had to cave and order online. I found a place where I can order Acana Grasslands at a competitive price - actually about a dollar less than what they were selling it for - with free shipping, so long as I order two bags. I really wanted to support a local retailer, but it seems All Paws isn't interested in selling me cat food.\n","\n","I wish All Paws all the success in the world. The two stars is because their grooming services are fantastic, but I am really very disappointed that they never even made an effort to order the food that I need for my pets, even after they told me that it would be no problem.\n","before 8\\/16: MEXQUITE HAS CLOSED. Submitted request for Yelp to update the restaurant. Went there for lunch today, and they've moved out. Sign and website are still up, but a paper sign in the window states an Italian restaurant is opening there soon. :-(\n","\n","\n","---\n","I've been eating here for a good long while now, so figured it was time to update my review.\n","\n","The most important thing you need to know about Mexquite? Two words: CHIPOTLE SALSA! It's the tastiest salsa I've found so far in Charlotte. When I go in, I not only get a side of it, sometimes I'll ask for a large takeout container of it to enjoy at home with our regular tortilla chips. Their chipotle salsa is the best.\n","\n","My favorite menu item these days is the burrito in a bowl. It's perfectly executed with rice, beans, plenty of lettuce and your choice of meat. It far surpasses the burrito bowl choices at other Mexican restaurants in the area.\n","\n","Pleased to see Mexquite doing well. If you haven't tried it yet and you're in the area, you should!\n","before We just returned from our inaugural visit to Agora, and I am thrilled to have found this Greek gem. Steve (the owner) could not have been more nice or informative. He was generous with the samples of feta and olives as we decided what to buy.\n","\n","All of our standard Greek favorites were there: barrel aged feta, kalamata olives, large canisters of imported Greek olive oil, tzatziki and Ion bars. We stocked up on our \"usuals\", but we were eyeing other things to pick up on another visit. They had some amazing looking chicken and pork souvlaki in the refrigerator case at a great price. Next time, we're getting some. In fact, all of the prices are incredibly reasonable.\n","\n","If you want the best Greek groceries available in Charlotte, I highly recommend Agora! It's a haul for us, coming from Ballantyne, but it's a trip well worth making!\n","before I've eaten at Taste many times since my initial review, and I haven't really found many dishes that excite me. It's mostly the \"default\" place I go when I'm in my uptown office for lunch.\n","\n","Today I tried the Grill area, and had a grilled chicken sandwich. It was a fine sandwich, and probably my favorite meal from Taste so far. I will echo what others have said here, the guy working the grill at Taste has a pretty bad attitude. It seems his default expression is a scowl. The look he gave someone when he couldn't hear what they were ordering, was quite rude.\n","\n","If you can get over his attitude, he does make a fine sandwich. Even if he clearly doesn't make it with \"love\".\n","before Bollywood Bites is both so wonderful, and so ghastly messed up that it's hard to write a proper review that reflects how wildly it swings to both sides of the spectrum.\n","\n","I happened to be driving right past the location today so I stopped in to pick up some chaat, just a quick little snack. It is indeed nearly impossible to find the restaurant. Just when you're about to give up, drive 100 feet farther and it's on your left.\n","\n","The woman in the front was nice and smiled a lot, but understood very little I asked, so I just went with an order of Samosas and an order of Aloo Tiki. She told me, \"No credit card.\" I said fine, that I'd brought cash.  She said she would go drop off my order in the kitchen and come ring me up.   I stood at the counter for five minutes before I decided to sit in one of the plastic chairs. I realized she wasn't coming back for awhile.\n","\n","She brought out my food about ten minutes later and told me it would be $7. I handed her a $20. She went in the back, then came back and asked me if I didn't have $7 exactly. I said I didn't, and asked if she'd take a check or something. (Lots of miming with my checkbook here.) She shook her head and made a phone call. I spent another 5-10 minutes waiting while she was in the back with my $20 trying to figure out what to do with it.\n","\n","Finally she came back to the front and went over to the cash register, that had been ignored throughout this whole time. While still on the phone she tentatively pressed a button twice and *woosh!* the cash register drawer flew open and her eyes lit up. Yes, she had to make a phone call to figure out how to get change for a $20.\n","\n","I left, amused at how screwy this place was and expecting never to return. Then I got home, and I tried the food. \n","\n","Here's the deal, the Aloo Tikki was the most flavorful Aloo Tikki I've ever had in my life. The Samosas were incredible. It is quite clear that there is a master in the kitchen at Bollywood Bites.\n","\n","But it is equally clear that the management of this little hole-in-the-wall restaurant is horribly inept. Both from the reviews here, and from my own personal experience trying to simply order $7 worth of food from them. \n","\n","Whoever is running the show has made a series of bad decisions and wrong turns. The location is terrible. The lack of tables is ridiculous. Leaving a woman to manage the orders who can't communicate and doesn't know how to open a cash register is laughable.\n","\n","I don't know whether to love Bollywood Bites or hate it. I am absolutely sure I will be back to try more of the delicious food, but I won't get too attached to the restaurant. It just doesn't feel like a place that's going to be there more than a couple of years at the rate it's being managed.\n","before Tried Dean \u0026 Deluca for lunch the other day. I agree with the other posters, that it seems to be a little overpriced. I also ordered the \"sirloin\" sandwich, and was expecting something more steak-like than a cold roast beef sandwich. The service was good and they have some unique items, but it just didn't impress me very much.\n","before I am officially becoming a Roaming Fork Groupie, which can't be good for my waistline. Every Thursday I make it a point to visit for lunch. A couple of things have changed, so it's a good time for an update.\n","\n","Since my initial visits, I've tried more dishes. The fried deviled eggs are good, but they really need the mustard sauce with each bite to add some tang. I've also had a chance to try the pamesan herbed fries, which were crispy and hot. The parmesan added just the right amount of flavor and salt. \n","\n","Finally, I've had a chance to try the famous blackened fish tacos. Here's the thing: I'm not a huge fish taco fan. Everyone raved about them, so I tried them, and I recognize that they are an excellent version of a fish taco... But that's not my favorite kind of food. If you like fish tacos, you'll almost certainly love these.\n","\n","What IS my kind of food? Well, the grilled cheese, as my previous review made clear. The past few visits, they've started offering the option of pulled pork on the grilled cheese. Oh. My. God. They took my two favorite sandwiches, and combined them into one. I think about that pulled pork grilled cheese - a lot. Usually when I'm eating a salad. Their grilled cheese sandwiches will keep me coming back for more, for a long time. Particularly if they keep offering pork with them!\n","\n","The last two trips out to Ballantyne, I've also noticed that they have an \"expediter\" managing orders at the window. Last week, she wasn't wearing a Roaming Fork t-shirt, and people thought she was waiting in line. This week there was a really engaged woman in a RF t-shirt greeting everyone who showed up right away. She did a great job, and I think the addition of someone to manage the orders on the front end, while they work on getting them put together inside the truck is a great one.\n","\n","There will be many more visits from me! All of the food is great, the people are so nice, seek them out and you won't be disappointed!\n","before My husband has been jonesing for Zeitouni ever since he started reading the reviews here on Yelp. We went a couple of weeks ago on a weeknight, and I have to say, I'm impressed.\n","\n","Having traveled to Italy and Greece, we are not strangers to Mediterranean food. Still, it was refreshing to have one of the young men in the restaurant meet our eyes as soon as we walked in, and ask if we'd like an explanation of their menu. He took us over to the case and showed us their kabobs, as well as their sides. He explained how we could order the different combinations, and then left us to confer amongst ourselves.\n","\n","We each ordered a platter. I ordered the chicken kabobs, my husband ordered the trio of kabobs. We ordered different sides in order to sample them all: hummus for me, babba ghanouj for my husband.\n","\n","We sat down to wait at a table, and after a few minutes they brought out our orders. Interestingly, our kabobs came with the wrong sides on the plates, but frankly this wasn't an issue since we were just doing a big old taste test of everything we could get.\n","\n","An older gentleman (perhaps the owner?) came by to present me with a garlic aioli sort of dip for the chicken. It was DELICIOUS and so garlicky! We asked for more, and asked what they called it. \"Chicken sauce,\" he said, with a laugh as he gave away the secret recipe of garlic and fresh mayonnaise. I don't care how simple it was, I loved it.\n","\n","The food was fresh and delicious. The staff was smiling and friendly. I couldn't ask for more from a restaurant. Well - maybe if it was sit down service with menus, but I won't dock them for that. Zeitouni is what it is - a counter service restaurant. Their food shines beyond \"counter service\" which implies almost a fast food style. Zeitouni is not \"fast food\" in my opinion. It's delicious, flavorful and fresh, designed to be savored. So it's a bit of a disconnect, but I forgive them for that because well, if you taste this food, you'd forgive just about anything else.\n","\n","My recommendation for dining at Zeitouni is that you call ahead and order delicious meals to enjoy in your home. If you're looking for a tasty and fresh lunch, or out for a quick dinner, it's an okay place ambiance-wise, in which to enjoy it, but the fast food feel might turn you off for a date night out. \n","\n","Regardless of how you enjoy their food, it is amazingly delicious food that is meant to be enjoyed. We'll be back again and again, but likely with a carryout bag to savor in our home. Zeitouni's food, and it's staff are elevated far beyond the atmosphere you'll find when you walk in.\n","before Had a great meal at the Bonefish Grill last night, our first time dining here. The restaurant is fairly small, and gets crowded on a weekend night. We had a 40 minute wait, but with a couple of beers at the bar, it passed quickly. Their draft selection of beers seems limited, with only 4 being available. \n","\n","Jessie, our waitress, took great care of us and service was fast. They were running a non-RW affiliated special, four courses (appetizer, salad, entree, dessert) for $30. We chose to go this route, even though the famous Bang Bang Shrimp wasn't listed as an available appetizer. (Jessie told us it was on special on Wednesdays for $5 so we might come back then to try it.)\n","\n","The food was very, very good. We loved the Wagyu Beef wontons. The Cesar salad was tasty, but a little too ice cold for my liking - it was hard to get any real flavor from it. I ordered the special filet, and my husband ordered the Ahi tuna, which arrived perfectly seared and rare on the inside. \n","\n","Based on our great experience, we will definitely return.\n","before Huge store. Clean. It's a shame they can't keep their shelves stocked. They also have a very limited selection. I never find everything on my list when I go here. Just a waste of time.\n","before So, I recently turned forty. What the heck are ya gonna do about it, right?\n","\n","Well, I'll tell you what I did about it - I went to Sona Med Spa in Ballantyne to inquire about a number of treatments.\n","\n","I'm not usually a vain person, but something just clicked when I hit the big 4-0. There are things that I don't like about my body, and dammit I have the means to do something about them, so why don't I? There's no reason to live with something you don't like if you don't have to.\n","\n","I visited Sona Med Spa and talked with Cassidy, who gave me pricing on laser hair removal (bikini and underarms) and laser treatments for the rosacea on my face. My leg hair was really too light for laser hair removal, so that was out, but I was sick of shaving the rest. \n","\n","For laser hair removal, I had previously visited \"Ideal Image\" for a quote as well. The woman was nice, but she tried to sell me on leg laser hair removal, even though my hair was clearly too light. Sona had MUCH better pricing on the laser hair removal, and I could get the AFT package for my rosacea at a great discount. Both combined were cheaper than the quote I got for just the hair removal at Ideal Image, so I jumped at the offer from Sona.\n","\n","I figured I'd wait until I was through with most of the package purchases before writing a review. So here I am, after 4 AFT and 4 laser treatments. The AFT has worked great. I had so many broken capillaries and veins on my face that I needed foundation just to look decent. After 4 rounds of AFT, I can't find a broken vein around my nose. My face looks more clear and calm and I don't have nearly as many flushing issues as I used to have.\n","\n","The laser hair removal has been a mixed bag. I'm about 50% done with hair removal by my observation, but I only have a couple of sessions left. I will probably need additional sessions for full hair removal. Still, after session 3, I really started to notice a decrease in hair on my bikini line and underarms.  There is still a way to go.\n","\n","To be clear: both procedures hurt. Some of them hurt like \"HECK\"! AFT is worse than the laser hair removal for me. (If your hair is dark and coarse, laser hair removal will hurt worse, but mine is medium coarseness, at best.) Sona will provide you with an Rx for a topical anesthetic ointment if you want. After 2 AFT sessions I opted to purchase the ointment. For my 3rd AFT session, I showed up with a face \"numbed\" by the ointment and having popped 4 Ibuprofen preemptively for pain. It was still awful. So awful that I decided to forego the ointment and Ibuprofen for my last session. If you're doing AFT, you kind of just have to suck it up and realize that beauty and even skin tone HURTS. Half of it's psychological. The other half is terrifyingly physical. :-) But if you get Roe, just chat with her and she'll help take your mind off things.\n","\n","Suffice to say, I celebrated my last session of AFT even though it meant no more sessions with my buddy Roe. \n","\n","I have to dock Sona Med Spa in Ballantyne a star because sometimes their scheduling is awful. I have waited for 65+ minutes for a 15 minute treatment before. They have lost two of my appointments. Their scheduling is terrible. Now, I get them to write my scheduling down on cards, and I save them like they're lifelines. I once received a call to confirm an appointment, and when I called back to say I could make it, they had LOST the appointment in their system.\n","\n","The people at Sona Med Spa Ballantyne are great, but their scheduling system is hideous. Be careful about scheduling and be prepared to wait an hour for your service. If they can see you in 5 minutes after you arrive, it's a bonus!\n","\n","That said, I arrived 45 minutes early for an appointment one time, because I had put it in my Outlook calendar for 11 (instead of 11:45 - seriously, save those cards!). When I showed up uber-early, the receptionist took the time to help me schedule all my next appointments AND answered all of my questions about Botox during the time I was waiting. So, as I said, they're good people. Just get firm on your appointment times.\n","\n","I do like Sona a great deal. Watch your appointment times like a hawk, show up and watch your age issues melt away.\n","before After six months of growing my hair out,  it got to the point where the ends had become so shaggy that if I drank too much wine, there was a high risk that I would take scissors to it myself. And we ALL know how that turns out. Fortunately, I was near Element 5 salon and I was able to score a walk-in appointment within the hour.\n","\n","My appointment was with Allison. She was friendly and listened as I told her the goals I was trying to accomplish by growing out my hair. She asked me what kind of look I was going for, if I wanted layers in the back or if I wanted it more straight, and we mutually agreed to take off  1.5 inches, or about half of the growth from the last 6 months, to even out the last remaining layers in the back.\n","\n","After a shampoo and conditioning in the sink, Ashley got to work on trimming my hair. Cutting hair, especially when you're trying to get it to grow out rather than cutting it in any specific style, isn't too challenging but the real risk is getting a stylist who chops off way more than you want, or who doesn't communicate or listen. Allison did a great job, and certainly didn't leave me surprised by the amount she cut, which I really appreciated. \n","\n","Allison pointed out that the only remaining layers were some face-framing layers, from some long ago grown out bangs. We agreed to just layer and soften the ends of the very front, leaving me with a softer framed look up front and no layers left in the back.\n","\n","I love the results of my much-needed trim, and the entire staff at Element 5 was welcoming and friendly. Allison recommended that I come in every 3 or 4 months if I'm trying to grow out my hair and just get a half inch taken off to keep things even. Now that I know this salon is there, I will be sure to get in more frequently as my hair grows out.\n","\n","All in all, a great experience. I'd recommend the salon to anyone in the area.\n","before I visited Del Frisco's a few months ago with some friends of mine. We opted to sit in the bar area, and just order some appetizers and drinks. The menu is quite pricey, but this restaurant is upscale along the lines of Morton's or Ruth's Chris. Dress nicely when you show up here.\n","\n","The service was attentive, professional and polite. It's exactly as great as you'd expect for a high end restaurant. The food was also a highlight. The appetizers we ordered were delicious. The fried calamari looked and smelled so delicious that I broke my \"I'll never eat *squid*\" rule and tried it. It tasted fantastic. \n","\n","Shockingly, I discovered at 40 that apparently I am incredibly allergic to calamari, as I went into mild anaphylaxis (it was my first exposure ever to calamari or any mollusc). Nevermind that, it was delicious! However, I've been informed that I am to never eat calamari or any other mollusc again. So sad. I'll say this, fried calamari was never tempting enough to even try until I it was in front of me at Del Frisco's, so there's that.\n","\n","All in all, a wonderful dining experience. Just a little pricey for my wallet at the moment. Highly recommended!\n","before The best way to describe the food at Nirvana II is that it tastes like disappointment.\n","\n","Located in the bottom of 3 Wells Fargo, there's a line out the door to this carry-out only restaurant most days. I love Indian food, so I've attempted lunch from this location twice. The second time was only after I suitably convinced myself the first meal wasn't as big of a disaster as I remembered. I was wrong.\n","\n","They don't serve authentic naan, you just get flimsy pita bread wedges. Their version of Chicken Tikka Masala is a gritty, brownish curry mixture that doesn't resemble a quality version of the dish in any way. The chicken may have bones, or it may not, it's really a surprise by the day.\n","\n","I've tried another dish -  chana masala from here, and it tasted the same. (Fortunately no bones!) Flavors are just muddy.\n","\n","Both times I've eaten here, I've tossed my lunch out half-eaten before finishing it. I don't understand why this restaurant is popular. How hard can it be to do Indian carryout right?\n","before Our visit to Mellow Mushroom on Saturday afternoon was truly a tale of two waiters.\n","\n","We arrived around 2:30 for some drinks and maybe an appetizer or two with a friend. Our waiter showed up, and was sort of a tripping kind of 'dude' guy who used the word 'Word' way too often, but was funny, engaging, and on top of things. We ordered our first round of beers, which came out quickly.\n","\n","Waiter Dude picked up on the fact that my husband likes craft beers, so shortly thereafter he came out with a sample he thought my husband would like. \"Dude, if you like the one you've ordered, you've got to try this one.\" So my husband did. He loved it, and that was ordered for the second round.\n","\n","Waiter Dude came out with the second round of beers and a sample of another new craft beer for my husband to try. We chatted a bit and decided we'd place a few orders for apps: pretzels, hummus and the oven baked wings. Waiter Dude was awesome, and then he disappeared.\n","\n","Like, literally, he disappeared. We didn't see him for another thirty minutes. We had to flag down a waitress and ask her about our food order and to please check on it. Three minutes later, our waiter was out with our food, all apologies about how it was held up by a huge pizza order or something like that. He brought no plates or napkins and said he'd be back with them.\n","\n","And then he disappeared again. For nearly ten minutes. Finally our friend had to get up and go inside to ask for them, and he returned out again, quiet and with apologies, put them down and bailed.\n","\n","My wings were refrigerator cold the instant they came out of the \"kitchen\" so I seriously doubt they had been held up by busily working on other things. I know this because I didn't bother to wait for the napkins to dig in, I was hungry.\n","\n","The food really wasn't good, and the service went from quirky and fun to terrible in the blink of an eye. We were there mid-afternoon. It wasn't like there was a rush. I certainly didn't see any huge pizza orders leaving the restaurant, or any huge groups entering the restaurant, and we were outside right by the doors.\n","\n","It takes effort to screw up a few rounds of beers and apps for 3 people, but Mellow Mushroom managed to. I really want to like this restaurant, but I have never had a reliably good experience there and the food isn't great either. I don't know how they stay in business.\n","before I needed to have my acrylic nails removed, and was looking for a new salon to do it. I found Allure via Yelp, and seeing the high ratings decided to pay them a visit today.\n","\n","Allure Nails \u0026 Spa is located off Community House Road in that new small shopping center near Ballantyne Corporate Park. They're near Genghis Grill\\/Another Broken Egg Cafe, etc. \n","\n","When I arrived there was only one other customer in the place. A woman greeted me and they quickly got me settled in and ready for soaking off my acrylics. After multiple rounds of soaking and filing, we'd arrived at my natural nails.\n","\n","The woman who greeted me introduced herself as Tammy, and the woman working on my nails was Van. As they saw how thin my natural nails were, both from the acrylics and just my nails being naturally thin, they recommended that I might want to try gel nail polish for a few visits to see if that would help keep my thin, brittle nails from chipping, splitting or peeling.\n","\n","I was really impressed by this, because when I've gone to soak off acrylics at other place, they've done the work and cleaned the nails, but never made any recommendations to keep my nails looking good. I'd leave and within hours or days, all my nails would look haggard again.\n","\n","I decided to give gel nail polish a try and I told Tammy that I wanted something very natural, almost like the french manicure look I was replacing. She came over with a couple of polishes and showed me what they looked like on her nails. I ended up choosing a very light iridescent pink that barely looks like nail polish, which I love.\n","\n","Midway through my treatment the door opened and 8 girls walked in for a party with a couple of moms. They didn't have an appointment, and there were only a few women working the salon. Tammy said they could take the girls in for manicures or pedicures, maybe 3 at a time, which seemed fine. I was impressed with how quickly the salon sprung into action to accommodate the new crowd of girls. I was also impressed at how Tammy got to know the girls' names, what the occasion was (a birthday) and how everyone at the salon interacted with the girls, and with me as well.\n","\n","I was really struck by how friendly everyone working at the salon was. Tammy and Van and others addressed regular clients by their first names as soon as they walked in the door. Tammy started calling me 'Cat' right after asking my name and I get the feeling when I show up again, she'll have remembered it! I'm terrible at names, which is one of the reasons I wanted to write this review so quickly before I forgot Tammy and Van's names! I'm always impressed with businesses that take the time to get to know people a bit better.\n","\n","I left with short, clean, polished nails and a plan to come back in 2 more weeks to get another manicure and pedicure with gel polish again.\n","\n","First impressions mean a lot, and I had a great first impression from my visit today. I'm a big fan of this place and the women working there, and highly recommend a visit!\n","before We had never purchased anything from the Meat House before, but that didn't stop me from bidding on a charity's silent auction item that featured several selections from their store.\n","\n","Several months after winning, I called the store owner and he was incredibly helpful, letting me know that I only needed to call them 20-30 minutes in advance to have my package ready for pickup.\n","\n","When we picked up our order, I was truly impressed by so much about the store: The variety and quality of their meats, cheeses and wine, and the samples of their meat, olive oil and vinegar on display. The storefront seems more like a place you'd find in Napa, California or Tuscany, rather than in Charlotte, North Carolina.\n","\n","The employees were friendly the moment I approached the place, with one wishing me a great day even as she was leaving at the end of her shift, and holding the door for me.\n","\n","I scoured the store looking for something truly unique to buy along with my auction items, and settled on crab cakes, one of my favorites since I'm from the Maryland area. A man behind the counter took pains to get me the best recipe to fix them, and even recommended a restaurant in town that he thought served the \"best\" once he knew I was a crab cake aficionado.\n","\n","I returned home with a slew of meat and a delighted husband, who graciously packed up everything in freezer\\/FoodSaver bags in portions we would eat. Everything we unwrapped was exceptionally fresh and a far step above what you might find in a grocery store's butcher selection.\n","\n","To date, we've feasted on hamburgers, chicken breasts, \"meat house\" marinated turkey tips and maple bourbon marinated steak tips. Last night we had the steak tips, which is what prompted me to write this review. Everything is delicious, but I could not get ENOUGH of the maple bourbon steak tips. As someone who \"hates\" bourbon (thanks to a college experience with some) I was wary of these tips, and ordered them only because my husband wanted them.\n","\n","They were the most delicately flavored, savory and tender bites of meat I've had in a long, long time. \n","\n","My husband is bragging to his friends about this \"great deal\" that I scored, and we look forward to trying the many other items we ordered from the Meat House. We are new customers, and we will most DEFINITELY be back. The quality of the food we've had from them is simply unparalleled. You owe it to yourself to try this place out.\n","before Visited for the first time last night and for a Saturday night the place was a madhouse. Still, the bartenders kept their cool, were fast on the drinks, and kept a smile on their faces throughout all the crazy.\n","\n","Didn't eat at Blackfinn last night, but their menu looked good so we stopped in just before noon today for lunch. Also wanted to see the restaurant when it wasn't packed wall to wall. Service was really prompt and solid, which almost always is the challenge new restaurants face. The wait staff seemed very well trained and I was impressed.\n","\n","Fish and chips were delicious. My husband loved his French dip style sandwich. I like this location much better than the uptown location. We'll be back!\n","before Visited OMB this past weekend for Mecktoberfest. The event has grown in size since we were there 2 years ago, so the outdoor tent was much bigger and food was included with the $25 price of admission, as were 2 beers. We were also given some sort of ticket for a prize drawing, which we never actually saw take place.\n","\n","There were only 3 beers on tap, Copper, Captain Jack and Mecktoberfest. It's disappointing to go for an all out \"Oktoberfest\" and get your choice of wow... Three whole beers. Captain Jack was way too hoppy and Mecktoberfest was too sweet, so I settled on Copper.\n","\n","The food was served by a catering company. I had the pulled pork which honestly, was the worst pulled pork I've ever eaten, anywhere. Baked beans from a can were also a disappointment. We purchased a pretzel later in the evening, which was cold. Definitely don't go to Mecktoberfest expecting decent food.\n","\n","Between dodging the cigar smoke everywhere outside, and the smell of feces inside (it was later reported by a guy in our group that someone had done something tremendously foul inside the men's bathroom - so over the top I can't even explain here) the evening would have been a bust if it wasn't for the company I was with. By 9PM the place seemed mostly empty, no one was outside and the band stopped playing, so we left.\n","\n","Overall, not nearly as enjoyable as our first visit to Mecktoberfest 2 years ago, which included much larger steins of beer instead of 21 ounce mugs. I'm not highly motivated to return to OMB for any events.\n","before Truly, truly a disappointment. I looked forward to Big View's opening, as I live very close to it. Hearing all the bad reviews, I figured I would order carryout one night. The way I looked at it, I couldn't get bad service if I didn't have to deal with a waiter.\n","\n","Surprise - they managed to royally screw that up too! In fact, Big View Diner screwed up every single step of the way.\n","\n","When I called, I asked for a menu item I found online, only to be told they didn't have that anymore. So I ordered something else.\n","\n","I showed up and informed the hostess I was there for carryout. She told me nothing was ready and asked me to linger by the sweets display. I loitered in the area, making eye contact with staff who immediately looked down and went on their way for 15 minutes, watching the register area like a hawk to see if they were preparing anything for carryout. \n","\n","FINALLY I went up to ask about my order. It had slipped my notice that my order was hidden to the side of the cash register, and had been sitting there for as long as I had been there! The cashier didn't even say anything about the fact I had stared at her for 15 minutes expectantly.\n","\n","The food was cold by the time I got it home, 5 minutes later. And it was awful. I ordered the \"hush puppies\" which the menu said came with some kind of butter, but instead I got this thick, cheese sauce. For hush puppies??\n","\n","I like Nolen Kitchen and Ilios Noche. I am baffled that this disaster of a restaurant is owned by the same folks. If I were Stratos, I would be humiliated to have my name and reputation attached to this \"diner\" with its horrible service, misrepresented food items, and sub-par food quality. In fact, my experience at Big View diner makes me wonder if I should bother going to ANY Stratos Restaurant Group establishment again. Were the others just flukes? Because it takes EFFORT to be as terrible as Big View Diner was in my first (and LAST) experience.\n","before I don't often crave eastern Carolina barbecue but when I woke up this morning I had just two words running through my head: \"Bill Spoon's\".\n","\n","Got there around 11:30 and was greeted by the friendliest people. Ordered the small plate with mac and cheese and potato salad. Don't you judge me.\n","\n","My glass of sweet tea was never empty. My craving for hush puppies was met with an offer of some more. Yes, please!\n","\n","Good food, served fast, from helpful and friendly people. Yellow checkered table cloths, wood paneled walls, ancient light fixtures that look like they belong in my momma's home. This is what the South is all about. At least, it should be.\n","before A star among the otherwise limited options available in the Overstreet Mall, Uncle Maddio's serves delicious pizza, at a decent price, quickly and with a smile.\n","\n","Pizzas, sandwiches and salads are made to order right out in front of customers so you can see everything that's going on. Maddios uses a modern conveyor style oven for their pizzas, so once yours is on the belt it's probably 8-10 minutes before it's coming out, piping hot and then straight to you.\n","\n","I tried the Steak \u0026 Blue pizza on my first visit, and it was so delicious I haven't been able to convince myself to order anything different on subsequent visits. You have a choice of white, wheat or gluten free crusts. Some people might get a little nervous about Blue Cheese on a pizza, but it's not overpowering and the balsamic glaze drizzled on after the pizza comes out of the oven creates a perfect flavor profile.\n","\n","The line forms quickly at lunch, and for good reason. From my desk in a nearby office building to Maddios and back with my carryout order it takes roughly 20 or so minutes, which gives me plenty of time to enjoy my pizza before my next meeting.\n","\n","The staff is incredibly friendly and efficient. They move fast and they have smiles on their faces. I've never seen a sullen person working at Uncle Maddios. \n","\n","The only downside is that the restaurant gets very crowded and there is almost never a table available, but I can't really fault the restaurant for being so popular.\n","before Visited the newest Jimmy John's in our area on Sunday afternoon. The place still has that \"new store feel\" it's so squeaky clean, but what made it really seem like a brand new Jimmy John's was the lack of experience from the people behind the counter.\n","\n","My husband ordered a #9 and asked for hot peppers as well. This completely flummoxed the young woman working the register, but after a couple of confused looks one of the guys making a sandwich said something to her and she put the order in.\n","\n","Next up, I ordered a #2, also with hot peppers. She repeated my order back to me, even as she got it wrong on the register.\n","\n","My husband received his sandwich with maybe 3 hot peppers on it. My sandwich had none, and the receipt showed she didn't include it when she rang us up.\n","\n","Everything about the people working there just screams \"NEW!!!!\" right now. I had to ask her to give me a cup for the drink I ordered after she just turned away from us to help the next customer. The wait for our sandwiches wasn't long but it was comical watching the guy behind the counter reposition each of our sandwiches several times, moving it by millimeters precisely before wrapping it.\n","\n","This was the worst experience we've had at Jimmy John's. I've never had them get my order wrong before. It wasn't a TERRIBLE experience in the grand scheme of things, but it's definitely below the standards I've seen in their Pineville store. I'll give this new location another chance, but not for another month or two so the staff gets a chance to learn how to ring up orders correctly.\n","before This is my kind of place. It's located in what's nearly a \"hole in the wall\" in a strip mall next to a buffet restaurant.\n","\n","This is a 'taqueria' by the most pure definition of the word. This is street food in a restaurant. I've ordered all the traditional tacos, and they are all delicious. The tortillas are perfectly cooked, the portion size is spot-on, and the radish, along with the toppings for each taco are fantastic. I could eat a dozen of these at a sitting, but I try to stop at 3.\n","\n","I've also tried the refried beans and the rice, both of which taste amazing. The beans are creamy and mild, and the rice is savory, but not over-salted.\n","\n","This place is authentic, and the owner is very friendly and engaging. I only drop one star for a few reasons: I wish that the chips and salsa weren't charged after the first basket (it's a low priced\\/loss lead food item, so not sure why they charge for extra), I also wish the wait staff was a bit older\\/more seasoned. Finally, I wish there were some milder salsas. I love Mexican street food, but this gringa in Charlotte can't take the heat! Their green salsa is the mildest heat-wise. I'd like more flavor and a bit less heat as an option.\n","\n","Still, 4 stars from me, and I recommend this place highly. I'm developing a craving again, just reviewing it! We'll be back soon!\n","before Visited Shane's for a late lunch this past weekend. It's a small place, located in the strip mall in front of Wal-Mart. You order at the counter, they take your name and give you a glass for your drink, and then they call your name when your order is ready.\n","\n","I ordered the smothered sandwich and a drink for under $10, with a side of potato salad. The food came out fast, and there was plenty of it for lunch. The potato salad was served in a styrofoam container next to the sandwich, which was packed with plenty of pork and cole slaw. I was a big fan of the cole slaw.\n","\n","The food was good, but it wasn't great. It's what I'd expect from a strip-mall barbecue place. I didn't taste much smoke. It doesn't taste like authentic Carolina barbecue to me at all. Still, it's plenty of food and a tasty meal with plenty of tangy sauces to choose from. It's on par with other chain-style barbecue restaurants in the area -  not knock-my-socks-off awesome, but solid and tasty.\n","\n","I recommend this place for families or couples looking for a low-key meal at a decent price. The restaurant is clean, and the service is attentive and friendly.\n","before What's with Hickory Taverns always being so dark inside, regardless of how bright it is outside? Maybe it's an attempt to contribute to a \"Tavern feel\" but at this small Hickory Tavern off Charlotte Hwy in Indian Land, it's almost depressing. \n","\n","The food here is good, and the service has been solid on multiple visits so far. Nothing to blow your socks off, however. I don't have any particular \"go to\" menu items at Hickory Tavern because nothing stands out as \"so delicious I want to come back for that\". I like to order the steak sandwich and then decompose it and eat it as a steak with bread and fries. I also have tried their lobster roll a few times. It's a passable lobster salad, and will do in a fix, but there are (thankfully) better ones in Charlotte these days!\n","\n","This is one of the few restaurants where I can feel comfortable ordering unsweet tea, knowing that it won't be bitter. They do a good job with their tea brewing. Hey, maybe THAT'S my \"go to\", their unsweet iced tea!\n","\n","Better for lunch than dinner, given how packed it can get in the evenings. If you're in the area and looking for a sports bar, Hickory Tavern's probably the best option for a few miles.\n","before After getting hit with some unexpected home improvement costs this year, we opted for a \"staycation\" this fall. Since we weren't spending a ton of money on hotels, airfare and restaurants, I decided to treat myself to an afternoon at the Ritz Carlton spa in Uptown.\n","\n","I was encouraged to arrive an hour or earlier before my first scheduled service to relax and enjoy the facilities, so I did. Check-in was quick, and I really liked the \"touchstone\" concept where you can choose a small stone that has written on it what you want from your day at the spa, and keep it with you and take home with you. (You can also add your own, if one of the many pre-written ones don't work for you.)\n","\n","The women's lounge is very, very nice. Everything you can imagine needing is readily available. There are several rooms to relax in, as well as multiple private showers, including one with something like 18 heads (it was like being in a car wash naked) and a steam room.\n","\n","The steam room was disappointing.  I fell in love with the eucalyptus steam room at the Ritz Carlton in Maui a few years back. It was clean and lit so white that it practically glowed. The steam was dissipated just right, and the eucalyptus was automatically infused with the steam so it was throughout the room. So when the front desk woman told me that the Uptown Ritz had a eucalyptus steam room, that's what I was envisioning.\n","\n","Instead, it was a yellow-ish room with somewhat dingy looking tiles, and a spray bottle that contained a a very watered down eucalyptus mixture. The Harris Y has more potent eucalyptus in their spray bottles than the Ritz.\n","\n","On to the treatments... I chose to do a body scrub treatment, followed by an hour for lunch and then a standard massage.\n","\n","The first treatment was interesting. I'd never done a body scrub before and I wasn't entirely sure what to expect. The treatment room had another nice, very private shower to use to rinse off the scrub mid-treatment before moisturizing. The therapist performing the treatment was good, but she was a little more 'handsy' than I'd like. I chalked it up to it being a \"full body scrub\" but I've never had a therapist massage my stomach, down between my breasts, etc.\n","\n","Lunch was great. I had ordered while relaxing in the women's lounge and locker area. After the scrub, I went up to the Aqua Lounge where there's an indoor pool and hot tub, as well as several chaise lounges, and my lunch was served there. It was delicious and not quite as insanely priced as I was expecting.\n","\n","My massage was also with the same therapist. It was okay, but certainly nothing special. I get better massages every few weeks at my local Hand \u0026 Stone. And again, the therapist was a little 'handsier' than I liked. It was clearly her style, so if I go again I'll probably seek out a different therapist.\n","\n","I spent another two hours after the massage just relaxing: swimming in the pool, alternating with the jacuzzi and occasionally heading down to the women's lounge to relax and get back into the steam room.\n","\n","I also wandered over to the fitness center to check it out, and I was fairly blown away by it, especially the room with at least 6 high quality spin bikes, all facing out the window overlooking Charlotte. Each bike had a rolled towel and a bottle of water. There were even complimentary ear buds packaged in a basket in the weight room if you forget to bring your own.\n","\n","Overall, my afternoon at the spa was wonderfully relaxing, and I enjoyed it greatly. Most of the facilities are top notch, although the steam room isn't. However, the services are incredibly expensive for what you actually get. I would consider returning, but not anytime soon. And I would probably opt for the least expensive service I could get, and just spend my day relaxing and enjoying the facilities. Better massages can be had elsewhere for far, far less.\n","before Visited Los Aztecas for lunch today, just to try something new. The restaurant is just about the only successful thing in this shopping center, and we've been scared off for years by the run-down appearance of everything around it. Still, every time we drive by, we see a TON of cars and a lot of action happening at this little restaurant, so we thought we'd give it a try.\n","\n","The back patio is a wonderful place to spend a nice sunny afternoon. Service was good, and as we had noted from previous drive-bys, the restaurant was very popular. We ordered beers (on a Sunday! When did that change in Fort Mill?) and we each ordered one of the lunch specials.\n","\n","The food was okay, but not exceptional. The chips and salsa were good. Our main dishes arrived quickly - almost disturbingly quickly - under 5 minutes from the time we ordered them. The chicken in my burrito seemed to be basic shredded chicken just rolled up and thrown under a heat plate. The \"avocado salad\" was just a ton of lettuce, a slice of tomato, and a tablespoon of guacamole on one corner.\n","\n","For these complaints though, I will say this - they were willing to work with us on sauces. I ordered an entree that came with a mole sauce, and the waitress let me request a tomatillo\\/verde sauce instead. My husband wanted a different sauce on his meal, and he got just what he wanted.\n","\n","Los Aztecas has the potential to be great, but at the moment it's only \"good\" because the food seemed slapped together. We're going to come again for dinner to order some \"specials\" to see if those meals seem more well thought out.\n","\n","If you're in the area and are craving Mexican food, stop by and have lunch or dinner. I know that we sure will. Just because it's not 5 stars doesn't mean it's not a good bargain and decent food!\n","before There appear to be two types of reviews for the Dog Bar in Charlotte. There are the \"Woohoo! Finally a place for my dog and me!\" reviews and then there are the, \"Yeah it might be a nice idea but dog poo and pee and free roaming dogs acting up... Ewww...\" types of reviews.\n","\n","I won't criticize the latter reviews, because I'm the kind of germophobe who won't put her purse on the kitchen table, and I take my shoes off when I'm indoors because I think, \"Eww... think about where they've walked!\" \n","\n","All this to say that I GET the folks who are less-enamored of the Dog Bar than I might be, and I GET their reasons. But as a woman who wakes up with cats pawing my face (and freakishly realizes where those paws have probably BEEN) I am learning to let go on the germ thing. Which, you kind of need to do when you visit the Dog Bar.\n","\n","We took our dog Ella to the Dog Bar for the second time on St. Patrick's Day. The first time we took her was last year, when their patio was still gravel, she was still a puppy, and I was a Nervous Nellie about her bothering people or sitting her butt in a drinking bowl. I have loosened up in a year, and she's chilled out a bit. So on our second visit, we had a simply PERFECT time. We planned to spend an hour, but we spent about four instead, socializing with new friends, and enjoying the show as our dog made new friends of her own, both human and canine.\n","\n","The Dog Bar does not serve food, but on weekends and for special events, they often have food trucks in their parking lot, or you can get carryout from other restaurants in the area. We ate our food from the Maki Taco food truck on the patio tables at the Dog Bar. Yes, dogs had recently lounged on the bar, but our food was protected by a styrofoam barrier, and we took care not to lick the tables.\n","\n","This year they put down new protective astroturf at the Dog Bar which is permeable, and designed for dog use. Dogs peed and pooped on said astroturf, and it was kind of a \"One for all and all for one\" mentality as the nearest human would pick up the poop with a bag, and hoses were available to hose the rest down through the astroturf. JP took care to point out on the Dog Bar's Facebook page that this astroturf is specially designed for dog use, meaning it's porous and is sanitized each night. I wasn't sitting on the astroturf, so I was no more bothered by walking on cleaned areas where dogs had peed or pooped than I would be at home in my  yard. (Hint, this is why I take my shoes off when I get home anyway.)\n","\n","The most important reviewer of our experience at the Dog Bar can't type. Her name is Ella, and she had a blast. In fact, she's looking forward to us going again, likely this weekend. If you have a dog, or if you don't but you love dogs, the Dog Bar is a great place for them to hang out. I wish we had something closer to home in Ballantyne, but for now we'll trek to NoDa to give our dog a great day, and to enjoy meeting new people. The Dog Bar is one of Charlotte's most unique experiences, and I loved going and can't wait to go back!\n","before Went to Cru to get a gift card for a friend for the holidays. Because it was such a miserable, rainy day outside, we decided to stay for a glass of wine. \n","\n","As others have said, we were greeted with a friendly handshake from the owner. There was a small group at the large table in the center taking a wine course, complete with an instructor, plenty of wine and a presentation on different wine regions.\n","\n","We took our seats at the bar, and went back and forth on what to order. Two of the reds we were interested in weren't available. There are only maybe 8 or so red wines listed by the glass, so it was a little frustrating to have our first choices unavailable.\n","\n","The woman behind the bar, as well as the owner, recommended some other options, however. And they were very generous about letting us taste two different ones before we selected our reds. \n","\n","The pours are generous and the wine was very, very good. In my house we call those types of pours \"Stanton\" pours, for my father who believes a glass of wine ought to have a slight undertow. For $8-$13 though, a generous pour is a prerequisite.\n","\n","We enjoyed the warmth of the decor and walls, and people which were in a stark contrast to the cold, gray dreariness going outside.\n","\n","When we were finished with our wine, we inquired about getting a gift card. In retrospect we probably should have asked for it up front because it took a little while, as the woman behind the bar needed the owner to help us get rung up with one and he was otherwise engaged.\n","\n","Cru has a great interior, and they also have entertainment during the week. We'll definitely go back. I like its laid back style, as opposed to another (heretofore unnamed) wine shop in Ballantyne Village which is much more of a \"see and be seen\" place. Cru just has a more welcoming ambience.\n","before My annoyance at being forced away from my desk to shuffle down a stairway on a sunny day for a firedrill while trying to run a meeting quickly disappeared when my coworker suggested I drop into Red Ginger to pick up some carryout on my way back into the office, solving both my need for lunch and my hatred of waiting at the elevator bank with 200 of my closest friends also returning from the firedrill.\n","\n","I've never tried Red Ginger before because it always seemed too sit down\\/fancy. Half the restaurant is dedicated to hibachi tables Benihana style, another quarter of it is a proper sushi bar, and then there's a regular bar and table seating.\n","\n","Placed my order for the shrimp hibachi combo, which at $11 included a drink, choice of soup or salad, and the usual veg and rice choices one gets with a hibachi combo. The wait was about ten minutes which passed quickly as a friend was waiting for another mutual friend in the restaurant, so she waved me over to come sit with her at her table while we both waited.\n","\n","The restaurant was fairly empty at 11:15, but my order came out promptly and as soon as I saw the guy walking from the kitchen with my carryout bag, I started the brief goodbyes with my friends. By the time I'd gotten to the front door, the hostess had my bag and soda in her hands ready to give to me. Highly efficient! As a bonus, the elevator banks had cleared out too.\n","\n","On to the food: There are two other places in Charlotte that I've mentioned on Yelp doing hibachi style food. The first (and least appealing) is TinTin up north by the Bank of America buildings. The second is Hasaki Grill, a little further south of my office building on the way to the BB\u0026T ballpark. I've written them up on Yelp, their food is good.\n","\n","So with those for comparison, Red Ginger is in the top 2, nearly tied with, perhaps slightly edging out Hasaki grill for ambiance in the restaurant, and flavorful food. My order came with six shrimp, a slew of rice, \"Yum Yum\" sauce and a brown ginger-based sauce. The salad came with the traditional bright-orange ginger dressing you tend to get at a hibachi restaurant. (I should know, I worked in one for a year in college.)\n","\n","For me, the real edge here has to be given to the restaurant that's most convenient, which is Red Ginger. It's located right in the base of my office building and I pass that corner every day on my way home from work.\n","\n","So, while I'm frustrated that I had to quickly cancel my meeting and disrupt my routine for a fire drill, I'm pleasantly full and surely headed for a mild food coma in an hour or so. I'll be keeping Red Ginger on my list for quick, nearby carry-out lunch options.\n","before Man, I really used to love this place. Just see my past review.\n","\n","Went to Moosehead today, Veteran's Day, for a little escape and to enjoy some wings and good bar food. It's always felt like a friendly neighborhood bar. In fact, while we were eating my husband lamented how many good locals were being lost to \"gentrification\" and we both said we hoped it never happened to Moosehead.\n","\n","Our lunch was cut short when the guy who appeared to be managing the shift came over to the table of two guys next to us. He wasn't professional enough to keep his hatefulness and ignorance inside, choosing instead to loudly started complaining with them about the \"douchebags\" and \"pussies\" who had protested a Trump win. Then, all three poor, victimized, disenfranchised white men  started complaining about how people were calling them \"racists\" because they voted for a man who eagerly incites racist violence.\n","\n","I came here to escape this kind of ugliness. I won't be returning. And in fact, I hope \"gentrification\" eventually puts this bar and the hateful, sexist, ugly people running it out of business, and soon.\n","before I tried Asian One right after they opened and found their Kung Pao chicken to be rather disgusting. Reading the review of the hibachi steak, I figured I'd give it one more go for lunch.\n","\n","I ordered hibachi chicken for carryout, and waited and watched while they prepared it and seemed to prepare a bunch of other items too, which must have been for other carryout orders since the other 5 people dining in were eating.\n","\n","Asian One has a completely open kitchen, which I sure hope doesn't bite them someday. I had a few concerns while watching them. Most notably someone grabbed a raw chicken breast from a bucket to put in the skillet, and then without washing their hands grabbed some raw vegetables and the tongs to cook with the chicken. No clue if this is a major hazard or not, but it's probably something I'd do at home and I figured everything going into that skillet was cooked within an inch of its life. Still, I'd think they might treat raw chicken like the nuclear biohazardous waste Food TV seems to think it is, in a totally open kitchen. (In all fairness, I'm sure none of us wants to see what happens in the CLOSED kitchens.)\n","\n","Brought the food home, and meh - it was okay. It was Tintin-like (the Uptown restaurant, for those who don't know it) in quality and taste, even including the weird creamy sauce I have gotten before at Tintin. I hate that mushrooms are pre-chopped to very small pieces in the vegetable mix so it's impossible to remove them. It was a $10 lunch, which is on the high side for what you get.\n","\n","Asian One is okay, but it's just not to my liking. My husband wants to try it so I'm sure we'll be back at some point, but really only for him.\n","before We decided to try Mama Lena's in Waxhaw because we wanted to try a small, local restaurant in town. It's a quaint little place and we were sat near the kitchen soon after our arrival.\n","\n","There are plenty of pastas and typical Italian fare on the menu. Their fresh baked bread is delicious and you can order beer\\/wine by the bottle or glass. Service was attentive, once the wait staff figured out who was going to serve our table.\n","\n","I ordered the manicotti, and I can't recall what my husband ordered. The food was good, but not overwhelmingly great. We enjoyed our meal, and it was reasonably priced.\n","\n","I don't know if we'll be back to Mama Lena's. It's not worth a trip out of the way, but if you're in Waxhaw proper and are craving pizza or typical Italian fare, it's worth a visit.\n","before Recently had lunch at Cosmos Cafe in uptown. I ordered the Steak Frites and wasn't asked how I'd like the steak cooked. It came prepared okay, but the meat was exceptionally gristly.\n","\n","Food and service alone would be a perfectly average 3-stars. However, we were seated next to some piece of wall art at a two-top. A large flying type of bug (flying ant, maybe?) made it's way onto our table twice, from underneath the wall art. I flicked it to the floor, and about two minutes later, another one emerged from behind the art, hovering next to our table. I could imagine the first one was a wayward insect that had flown in the restaurant, but when I saw a second one I began to suspect that there might be an infestation in the restaurant. I won't be dining at this Cosmos location again.\n","before Visited the new Ballantyne location of Midwood Smokehouse yesterday for lunch. I was by myself and figured the location would be insanely crowded, but decided to walk in to see.\n","\n","I've tried to talk my husband into going, but he's always adamant that he likes to give new restaurants \"a month or so\" to work out any kinks before he tries them. Since he was off doing something else for the afternoon, it was my chance to try it without him.\n","\n","The restaurant was busy, but there was no wait and there were seats available at the bar. I grabbed a chair and ordered a PBR ($2.50 drafts!) and after a brief review of the menu, figured I'd try the side dishes\\/veggie combination plate instead of going for actual barbecue on this visit. I figure this way my husband can't get TOO upset that I went without him for my first visit! \n","\n","I ordered the creamed corn, cole slaw and stuffed jalapenos. I was originally going to get hushpuppies as one of the items but Chad, the bartender, assured me my dish would come with a few since the platter of sides was considered a \"plate\". When it came out devoid of hushpuppies he noticed instantly and said to the foodrunner,  \"We're going to need a side of hushpuppies and pickled onions for that.\" They were delivered right away. Thanks for having my back, Chad!\n","\n","The creamed corn was delicious. I chose to believe it was \"healthy\" in spite of the clear abundance of well, cream, in the dish. I was least enthusiastic for the coleslaw, but it ended up being my favorite item on the plate! The 3 jalapenos were delicious, but a little small. I'm used to a friend's bacon-wrapped jalapenos which are not halved, and are enormous. \n","\n","Some people have written that they find the hush puppies too sweet. I find them to be just perfect, no ketchup needed to enjoy! I also loved the pickled onions. I devoured everything on my plate quickly, and found it to be just the right amount of food. I've never had a chance to try all the delicious sides I've wanted, so this was a great opportunity.\n","\n","Chad made me feel welcome and was very attentive, getting me a second PBR just before mine went empty. We shared some Words with Friends strategy during a moment of downtime, as he saw I was playing on my phone.\n","\n","I was very impressed just watching Chad work. He handled a few carry out orders, and as each one showed up, he opened up all the containers to quality check them, and went back for a few items with each one. This restaurant, being so new, probably still has a little confusion going on, but he made sure every order was right, whether it was mine or the carryout orders.\n","\n","All told, my bill was $12.99 for a delicious meal and 2 PBR's. The value for what I received can't be beat!\n","\n","I was originally thinking I might be uncomfortable eating solo at what is so clearly a sit down family restaurant, but the bartenders were all very friendly, and it was such an enjoyable lunch I definitely see swinging by for more solo lunches in the future!\n","before Razzle Dazzle is the closest salon to my house whose groomers I trust. They're a small storefront, located just a few doors down from Curtsinger Animal Hospital, which is my dog's veterinarian. I like that they're both so close to each other in case there are any issues.\n","\n","I've taken Ella to Razzle Dazzle several times, and they usually give her a bath and a paw trim. I called yesterday to inquire about a full grooming and they informed me that they were booked several weeks up for a full groom, so I just brought her in for a bath and a trim of her paws. I think they must have taken pity on her rattered-tattered ears and flanks, because when they called me to come pick her up they said they'd managed to give her a cut as well - what a nice surprise!\n","\n","I really like that the dogs are free to roam about in the grooming area before and after their service. It's basically a mini doggy day care atmosphere with the benefits of grooming services as well! \n","\n","Prices are very reasonable. I'll only give the caveat that if you want a proper cut, be prepared to book in advance for it because they're definitely busy. They're just a great salon.\n","before We've been here several times since they opened a year or two ago. The service is okay, but I agree with others that their food needs a lot of work and their beer selection is limited. The issue I have with PJ's is that they have a real good game on the outside - their bands, their decor, their service, but their drinks and food just don't deliver.\n","\n","For instance, \"Sassy Chicks\" isn't a menu item I would want to eat anywhere, although it's PJ's ridiculous name for one of my favorite (usually)  menu items (chicken fingers) in other restaurants. Don't get me started on the similarly unappetizing and stupidly named \"Barney Stone Sliders\" or \"Flapping Arms\". I sincerely don't know how the wait staff refer to these menu items without sneering, scoffing or otherwise looking put out, and I sincerely don't know what the owners were thinking when they put together a menu with such outrageously hideous names. I don't want to sound like I'm at some stupid themed restaurant when I order food, and when I go to PJ's I end up trying to convey to the waiter what I want without using their unbelievably sophomoric names for the items. Seriously, PJ's owners, how hard would it be to refer to chicken wings as \"chicken wings\" and not as \"flapping arms\"... is that too simple and straightforward for you all to consider? Do you really think you're adding value with stupid names?\n","\n","Second, for an Irish place, they simply don't highlight classic Irish food at all. For instance, there's another very successful Irish bar\\/restaurant in Charlotte (which shall remain anonymous) with a menu that offers Shepherd's pie, Irish potato cakes, potato and leek soup, and soda bread. PJ's offers none of these, although they have ridiculous names for imitation items like \"PJ's Pie\", \"Loaded Spud Soup\" or \"Onion Soup\" and God help us all, \"O'Fries\".\n","\n","I hate gimmicks and PJ's is relying on cheap gimmicks for their menu, the food from which is served on cheap black plates and looks like fast food when it arrives at the table.\n","\n","While PJ's is an okay place to stop in for a quick beer, I'm disappointed by it greatly, overall. Mostly because I feel the owners have a real opportunity to showcase Irish food and Irish bar food in south Charlotte and they've totally squandered that opportunity in favor of gimmicks. I sincerely hope that PJ's someday becomes the Irish bar my husband and I dreamed of walking to several times a week before it opened. Because we discovered after it opened that it's really just a cheap imitation \"Irish Disneyland\" wannabe that isn't really worth visiting.\n","before There have been stories in the news lately about business owners vilifying their unhappy customers on social networks after their establishment received negative reviews. In light of that textbook example of how NOT to do business,  I'm happy to say that Elwood's management sets a perfect example of how you SHOULD do business.\n","\n","After my first, lackluster review of Elwood's, and particularly of their pork barbecue, Justin - the owner of Elwood's reached out to me. He let me know they had reworked some of their menu items, including how they hold the pork after it's cooked, so that it retains its flavor better. He offered to send me a gift certificate to try out the restaurant again. I hung onto the certificate over the holidays and my husband and I managed to get in to give Elwood's a second try last Thursday.\n","\n","I ordered the pulled pork platter, along with hush puppies and macaroni and cheese. As we waited, someone came by with some cornbread for us, which I hadn't been able to try on my first visit. It's good, but a little cakey and a bit messy because it falls apart so easily.\n","\n","Once our food arrived, I couldn't wait to dig into the pork. Justin wasn't lying, the pork really IS really good now. It had a nice smokey flavor to it, which was exactly what I was missing before. It was substantially improved over the pork I had the first time. My husband ordered the potato wedges and green beans along with brisket (I think, I wasn't looking over at his plate much because I was so busy with my own). We both really enjoyed our meal.\n","\n","If Yelp allowed for 4.5 stars, I'd grant it to Elwood's. I enjoyed my meal and I will be back. Equally as impressive as the food improvements however, are the people who run and staff this restaurant. They are a class act.\n","before Haven't been back to Duckworth's often since my first review, but visited yesterday and saw reason to update my rating.\n","\n","The beer selection and quality at Duckworth's is top notch.The service is good.\n","\n","The food, however, is not. Or more fairly, the menu at Duckworth's is hit or miss.\n","\n","Ordered the St. Louis style ribs yesterday, with cole slaw as a side. The food arrived on an enormous plate.\n","\n","As I tucked into my food, I could swear I tasted... lighter fluid? I don't know, something \"off\" about the ribs. They tasted chemical-like, not smoked. \n","\n","The cole slaw was warm, and also tasted slightly rancid.\n","\n","The garlic bread tasted like my dad's version, which is to say it was drowned in garlic salt... Blech.\n","\n","The tater tots? They were fantastic. But COME ON! They're tater tots!\n","\n","If you're going to Duckworth's, stick to pure bar fare. Wings, potato skins, etc. Probably your safest bet.\n","before Stopped in to Maxwell's on Sunday afternoon. The food was good, and the service was very efficient and friendly. Their burgers are enormous! My pulled pork BBQ sandwich was okay. Not phenomenal, but not bad. I think I'm just spoiled by better barbecue in the area. Definitely an enjoyable place to hang out and grab lunch or dinner!\n","before Went here for lunch today. I had never visited the old location, but I'm glad to see the restaurant is back and in a great new location. There was soccer on the big screen, and cold beer on tap. Really enjoyed my fish and chips, but for an \"authentic\" British Pub, I was disappointed that I couldn't substitute mushy peas (a $3 side item) for cole slaw (also a $3 side item) for my entree. I've had mushy peas with my fish and chips all over London. I've never been served cole slaw with them in the UK before. They seriously ought to consider giving you an option. They take so many steps to seem authentic, but they totally blow it by not allowing authentic sides with the fish and chips.\n","\n","Still, service was good. We'll be back. Hopefully they'll get it together on offering fish and chips with mushy peas, the way you'd really get it in London.\n","before If you want to eat here for weekday lunch, get here early. This tiny restaurant fills up quickly, so by 11:45AM there was already a wait list on my last visit.\n","\n","This restaurant is tucked behind a fountain in a corporate building and I never would have found it if a friend hasn't taken me there on my first visit.\n","\n","The menu is filled with delicious sushi items and combos. The only problem with that is I don't like sushi. (I've tried, I really have! I've never felt such peer pressure to like a type of food.) Fortunately, they have some non-sushi alternatives on the menu, but not very many.\n","\n","My usual dish is the Sesame Chicken, and it's good, but not great. The sauce tastes like it's artificially thickened pretty heavily (more than a little cornstarch in it, I think) and it's spooned over the chicken, rather than the chicken being tossed in it. I tried ordering the shrimp version of the dish once, and it was a mess. The coating was falling off the shrimp and it was more trouble to eat than it was worth.\n","\n","Service is solid, if unremarkable (that's a good thing, in my book) and the price is reasonable. My friends love it so I keep visiting, but I probably wouldn't go if it wasn't someone else's idea.\n","before Sis! Happy birthday!\"\n","\"Bro, my birthday was in June.\"\n","\"I know. I'm taking you to Petit Paris. Woah, look at this city, it's PERFORMING! What's THAT building? And that one?\"\n","\n","This was the exchange that occurred when my excellent brother stepped off the train at the beginning of his visit last month.\n","\n","Now then. There are two reasons that Petit Paris was the first place that sprang to my brother's mind when he wanted to take me out for a meal in a city he'd only actually visited once before. The first is that he didn't really know anywhere else. The second is that he was genuinely impressed with it when he came to Edinburgh last and he doesn't like to give shoddy presents; he's good that way.\n","\n","Well, I see why he was impressed. The waiter who took our coats and saw us to our seats (table complete with cute gingham tablecloth) was cheery and warm, and plenty patient as we ummed and ahhed over the delicious-looking menu. We began with snails to share - yes, folks, I do the snail thing, and if you have not done the snail thing, Petit Paris is probably the place to do the snail thing. Rich in a garlic and parsley sauce, and blissfully un-chewy, they nestled in indentations in the special snail-dish like happy little blobs of buttery snaily joy. That dish, by the way, makes the process great fun and also, when you're sharing as we were, easy to ensure equitable division of the very good goods.\n","\n","(I like to imagine that I am a hedgehog when I do the snail thing. That's just an irrelevant little side note for your entertainment.)\n","\n","My main was the goat's cheese and vegetable pie - utter bliss. The number of times things get passed off as pies when they're really just tarts is so disappointing. The difference, of course, is that a pie should have pastry on the top. This, to my delight, did, and the pastry was superb. Likewise the filling; the goat's cheese was liberal although it could have perhaps been more evenly distributed as it took me a couple of forkfuls to find it, hiding as it was under its pastry blanket. Bro was less ecstatic about his rabbit, proclaiming it a little stringy, but generally adequate.\n","\n","Having ordered, in a moment's forgetfulness, a bottle of wine instead of a glass, Bro must have been happy enough with its quality; it was all gone by the time we left and as anyone who reads my reviews regularly will know, Sis was by no means his glamorous assistant in this vanishing act.\n","\n","It's not the cheapest place to eat in Edinburgh, but at around £20 for a starter and main it's very reasonable indeed, especially given the undeniable quality.\n","before Yellow Bench has a Yellow Bench outside. It does when it's open. For this reason, I marched straight past it when it wasn't quite open yet and realised too late that I had gone too far, and so from being slightly early to meet Sara C I went to being slightly late. But no matter. The bench was there when I returned and bears the charming legend \"BY SITTING ON THIS BENCH I AM OPEN TO CONVERSATION WITH A COMPLETE STRANGER\". (There's one of these outside Zupa too). One weekend when I have a free moment I intend to go and sit on that bench.\n","\n","But anyway.\n","\n","Yellow Bench is a sweet and small establishment on Leith Walk with a splendid line in Polish food. They've got a crepe-related check-in deal of which I totally need to take advantage sometime, since they also have a mighty fine crepe menu and I am a sucker for those flipping flippies. On this particular occasion, however, I had veggie golabki, a beautiful and flavoursome medley of vegetarian yummies and rice all stuffed into a cabbage leaf container, kind of like a floppy green burrito covered in yummy sauce. This was my first taste of Polish food and I confess I might be converted.  It was dee-LISH.\n","\n","So, Yellow Bench, you are yet another lovely thing that I have found in my new neighbourhood (hat tip to Sara C) and I am very happy to be living near you, thank you.\n","before When you're dealing with a party of 20 or so, finding the time to tweet them a photo of the beautifully-set Christmas tables all ready and waiting, WELL before they arrive, is probably a sign that you have got things well under control. And when you manage to bring out all of the dishes for each course in fairly impressive synchrony, well, that's confirmation.\n","\n","L'Escargot Blanc is fine dining, but it doesn't feel like it. It's not intimidating; trundling up the stairs past French posters to be received at the top by someone taking coats, it feels more like visiting a friend's rather nice West End flat. It's not particularly spacious or impressive; it's sweet, and it's warm, and it's welcoming. That said, we weren't cramped; it isn't little - just cosy.\n","\n","We were all served an aperitif aux truffes - a mushroom aperitif? Really? But it did smell fabulous and those who consumed it all seemed to agree that it was excellent. For a starter, I had butternut squash and chestnut soup - absolutely delicious. It was still piping hot and the chestnuts provided a gorgeous addition to both texture and flavour. I would have liked to see more bread - there was a basket for everyone before the starters came out, with a small pat of butter served on a wooden spoon (adorable!) but we were greedy birds and had consumed most of it before the course arrived - but on reflection, given what was to come, I'm glad there wasn't!\n","\n","Next up was turkey, with more chestnuts. Hey, don't judge me; I've never had chestnuts before and I was excited. Plus, if you can't have turkey at a Christmas dinner, when can you, eh? Actually, venison with beef cheek in front of me to begin with. However, the head waiter instantly noticed my puzzled expression and scooted over from the other end of the room as though on a hoverboard (come on, science, get your act together, you've got less than two years now), crying \"Ah, but you're not having that! You're having turkey, no?\" How he remembered this is utterly beyond me but I was super-impressed.\n","\n","Ah, turkey, that contrary bird, sticking its tail feathers up at ease of preparation, insistent on being dry and tasteless... well, not at L'Escargot Blanc. It was as delicate and flavoursome as the best chicken, but obviously turkey-tasting. The potato puree on which it was served was a spuddy dream come true - creamy and lush, with for perhaps the first time ever, enough salt for me; it actually almost stole the show!\n","\n","The final delight of the evening was the iced vacherin. In the spirit of Yelpy adventurousness, I ordered it for the exact reason that I had no idea what it was. It turns out that it's basically Eton Tidy. It's what Eton Mess looks like before you beat it with a mallet, and with added ice cream and crushed hazelnuts. This is, in short, an epic win.\n","\n","I'm definitely putting L'Escargot Blanc on my list of \"places to take people I want to impress\". In fact, I'm starting that list especially for this review.\n","before I don't want to spoil the party here, folks... I don't know. The Chocolate Tree just wasn't as much of a swizzle of fairy dust as I'd been expecting. It was nice, for sure. It was cosy and cute.\n","\n","My expectations may have been too high; not that I was picturing myself leaving the premises like a confectionery version of Queen Elsa in Frozen, summoning flurries of rich chocolate at my fingertips, but suffice to say I was preparing to feel ensconced in a warm choccy glow, and instead I just felt like... Well that was nice.\n","\n","I have something of an issue with places that don't make it clear whether you order at the counter or wait for service. To be honest, I'm still not entirely clear on that; it seems like a waitress service sort of place but after waiting for twenty minutes we ended up just going up and ordering. It's not a big place but always busy so be sure to book ahead. Cute and weeny, it fits in in the area very well, and let's not forget they also have a check in deal if you're in the market for buying chocolate bars! Always a good thing.\n","\n","The hot chocolate was really very nice; sweet and in a nice big mug I could wrap my hands around. The legendary churros were less of a delight; a little dry and over-cinnamoned, I felt, but nice and twisty nonetheless and not stingy on the portion. And it's a genuinely lovely little shop; we sat in the tiny corner by the window and watched the world go by for a while. So in all, it's a definite three from me, in that I'd gladly return at someone else's suggestion but probably wouldn't be the person to suggest it myself.\n","before I have always suffered from bus anxiety. How do I know which number to get? Which is my stop? How do I plan a route? What will the fare be?\n","\n","I love Edinburgh and I don't want to leave, but above all, I don't ever want to have to deal with a bus service that isn't Lothian Buses ever again. Let me put you in the picture. I lived in a tiny rural Yorkshire village ten minutes' drive from the nearest town. There were six buses there per day and the return fare was more than £6, varying depending which bit of the town you wanted to get off at.\n","\n","Lothian Buses make EVERYTHING easy. Going somewhere, madam? £1.50. Coming back, madam? Another £1.50. Going to be doing lots of journeys today, madam? £3.50 day ticket. Boom. Pricing sorted.\n","\n","Where are you going today, madam? Check the app. This is your bus stop. These are the services that will take you there. This is when they are due, and how long each journey will take. This is the stop you need to get off at. Some of our buses even have screens, madam, to tell you which stop you are approaching, so that you will know it is time to get off.\n","\n","And can we also talk about the fact that they run on time? Yep, they run on time. They go everywhere and they run on time. And if you don't have the correct change for your fare, you can buy a magical e-ticket through the app so you can just wave your phone at the driver. Kaboom.\n","\n","Lothian Buses are proof that it's possible to run an efficient, timely service at excellent value to the ticket-buyer. Hooray!\n","before Due, no doubt, to its being the largest working theatre in the whole of the UK, the Playhouse always has an impressive programme. There are a lot of seats to fill, and there are plenty of other venues in Edinburgh playing to the more adventurous, so there's nothing to criticise about the fact that the Playhouse caters to a popular audience. Large-scale touring musicals (usually from London's West End) are the main bill of fare, with big-name musicians and successful TV comedians forming the bulk of the rest.\n","\n","As you'd expect, it can deal with pretty much any technical requirement. The stage is enormous, and the lighting demands the Playhouse accommodated for the Joe Bonamassa concert last month were pretty jaw-dropping. I think it might have been the most complex rig I've ever seen.\n","\n","The first time I came here (to see \"Oliver!\" - Samantha Barks was playing Nancy) I was amazed at its apparent application of timelord technology. It looks so weeny from the front, but inside... golly. It just goes on and on. I don't just mean the capacity, but the fact is that the seats in the balcony aren't as steeply raked as many other theatres so the rows are more widely spaced; there was sufficient leg-room even for a giantess of my lengthy proportions. Joy! That does mean, however, that the back row is really quite far back, but the sightlines from just about anywhere in the main auditorium are pretty faultless (even in \"restricted view\" seats).\n","\n","The only part that seems rather cramped is the foyer; there isn't much room for milling about pre-show. However, the front-of-house staff are all pretty perky; it's a marked contrast with theatres in London, which are peopled for the most part by out-of-work actors and generally have an air of wistful despondence as a result.\n","\n","One parting fact: I read recently that this was originally, when built in 1929, a cinema. A CINEMA. Oh, how I wish that cinemas these days had vaulted ceilings, gilded boxes, noble-featured statues and comfortable velvet seats. And Ambassador (Theatre Group), with zis four-month residency of ze Lion King you are spoiling us.\n","before I had walked past here many times; this weekend was my first venture inside. Maybe it's the dull hue of the paint used on the sign outside, but I was thoroughly taken aback by its pleasant and light interior. Not what I was expecting at all. It's quite kooky, as well, with a clock decorated with brightly-coloured cutlery, and a lovely piece of art on the wall that reminded me of something Dr Seuss might have created if given the brief \"stringy lake of afternoon tea\".\n","\n","The Purple Pig is very nice, though nothing extraordinary; it wins the fourth star for its pricing, though, with a pot of tea costing what I expect a pot of tea to cost (less than £2), some very nice cakes and a reasonably-priced and delicious-looking breakfast menu which I'm keen to go back and try.\n","\n","I'm pretty happy about finding this place, because I've been hoping to discover a nice, simple, everyday kind of cafe in Tollcross for a while. This is now it!\n","\n","Also... it cannot go unmentioned that the teacups are covered with roses. TWING! Fourth star is firmly in place.\n","before HOLD IT. HOLD IT. As some of you know, I am on an ongoing mission to find the greatest Eggs Benedict in all of Egginburgh. For many months, Kilimanjaro Coffee has held the crown. No longer. No longer.\n","\n","I don't know what made it so amazing here. The bacon, for a start, is not how I like my bacon - it was streaky and on the side, instead of back rashers sitting snugly under their eggy blankets. And yet. And yet. And yet. The eggs were poached to perfection and, once cut into, ran free and wild across my plate with joyous abandon. The muffins on which they were served were light and fluffy. The hollandaise was absolutely packed with flavour - with the addition of a quick sprinkle of black pepper, it blew my mind. And the bacon... just... worked. It just did. It's magic. The dish, teamed with a creme caramel rooibos, set this urban wanderer winging her way, harp and all, up to cloud nine in seventh heaven.\n","\n","Urban Angel is surprisingly capacious inside, made of lots of little rooms, but don't come here if you suffer from any kind of body dysmorphia as much of their decor consists of mirrors - including a charming pair in the shape of wings. The recess into which the hand basin fits in the poky little ladies' is also panelled with mirrors (which is kinda weird when you stand up to pull up yer knickers, know what I'm sayin'?). It's also below street level so you'll more than likely lose phone signal.\n","\n","But when they've got eggs like that, and a menu that includes a raw chocolate shake, endless smoothies, Eteaket teas, Edward \u0026 Irwyn hot chocolates, and lots more unbelievably scrumptious things, you can forgive a few little things like that.\n","before For two games for an adult, it's £12.49, which seems reasonable to me. They estimate around an hour per game if your lane is full (6 people) so I guess that works out that you're paying around the equivalent of minimum wage for a good deal of fun.\n","\n","It's a bowling alley, with everything that goes with it (arcade machines, terrible music, and goodness knows who else's fingers have been in those holes before yours) but it feels friendlier to me than most bowling alleys I've been to. Also, while I can't speak for the rest of their food, the chicken nuggets are not bad, and the drinks are what I would call fairly reasonably priced.\n","\n","The sad part is that they can't do score sheet printouts, so the only answer is to snap a quick photo of the score screen with your phone. It seems odd to me that this is central Edinburgh's primary alley and it doesn't do the things that the bowling hall in rural Yorkshire did - score printouts, and humorous animations on the occasion of a gutterball, split, spare or strike. It's basic. But there's also a sneaky thing. If you bowl it just right and catch it just as your first ball is going through the system, your second ball can bounce off the mechanism and hit some of the pins it missed as it went by. Woop woop!\n","before I will never understand how it took me so long to get around to coming here. And if I'm not back within two weeks then I shall eat my hat.\n","\n","Because first of all... Colour. It is like walking into a rainbow of happiness. The walls are made of colours and on them are fluorescent vinyls painted with adorable characters and scenes (these are for sale and I would like one please if anyone reading this is looking for a present for me).\n","\n","Aurelie M and I were lucky to get a table - we arrived right at the start of the lunch wave; ten minutes later and it could have been curtains for our lunch plans. Lacy, gently wafting curtains...\n","\n","I opted for the Cajun wrap, which was wonderful, toasted to crispness on the outside and burrito-like in contents. With the side salad it was the perfect amount. I also had the Betty Ford juice, which was delicious and tasted very wholesome. I tried Aurelie's Pink lady too and it was SO GOOD. I want a whole one to myself!\n","\n","Aside from a slightly perfuctory dump-dishes-and-run moment from the staff member so brought our orders (totally understandable given that the place was packed by then) this was a wonderful experience from start to finish and we never felt rushed to move on despite the people who never stopped appearing.\n","before Sandy Bell's is best known for its nightly session; a lot of sessions can descend into chaos with a surfeit of guitars and squeezeboxes, but on the night we went everything was very nicely balanced. The bouzouki and flautist were especially good and they had a solid bunch of tunes (not just Irish ones) in their noggins.\n","\n","There's also a chess board high up on a ledge round the corner in a small nook; you have to ask at the bar for the box of pieces and the clock. The pieces come in a sticky plastic box that has clearly been baptised in beer many times but they themselves are clean, and the nice big kind you can properly plonk down on the board. For the first time ever, I beat my brother (then for the second and third time. Perhaps I had an unfair advantage in that I was only drinking water and he was trying out the whisky stock...) and the lad at the bar was thrilled to entertain some chess players. Apparently they used to have a chess club but most of the players got barred, so he hasn't seen chess going on for a while!\n","\n","In terms of its interior and atmosphere, it's a fairly standard pub; not much different from what I expect from the word \"pub\", although my brother was reasonably impressed with the range of whiskies on offer. The highlight for me was a copy of \"Brecht On Theatre\" on the bookshelves! Now there's something you don't see every day... So: chess, session, and Brecht lift this above the average pub for me. Nice one, Sandy's.\n","before Come for the saving, stay for the quality. By not providing non-essential things like hairdryers (but there are power sockets if you want to bring one), towels (again, bring your own) or Wifi (seriously, who needs that in a gym?!) this gym can pass on the saving, meaning they can offer a rolling month-by-month membership for just £16 (and I think there's a wee joining fee of about £20). Compared to a huge number of gyms in the city, that's almost obscenely low. Pennies! Plus, if you know you're not going to make it there for a month, which is especially applicable in Edinburgh (cough August cough) then you can suspend your membership and skip all but £5 of that month's payment. Niiiice.\n","\n","But how does the budget translate to the gym itself? Well, when I was at university in Exeter, I paid more than double this membership to be with Fitness First, and there's no contest. The Gym Edinburgh is lighter, more spacious, more welcoming, and the equipment is not only top-notch but also plentiful. I can't think you'd often have to queue for a treadmill. All the same, I like to go quite late at night (it's open 24\\/7) since it's quieter, although I've never been there alone. I don't think I'd feel unsafe if it happened though!\n","\n","The atmosphere is really something else too; I used to feel intimidated at my last gym but everyone just gets on and trains here. There is a timetable of free classes, as well, which I've yet to explore but looks very comprehensive. You can get a personal trainer at extra cost if you want to. If you forget a padlock for the lockers, there's a vending machine selling them for a couple of quid. I love that. A padlock vending machine. Whee! Novelty points.\n","\n","The showers are surprisingly good. They're on a motion-sensor so you might have to do a little boogie or tap the sensor if you find yourself right in the middle of sculpting a fine shampoo mohican when the water cuts out, but better that than a wasteful shower which goes on streaming after someone's lazily wandered out of the cubicle without switching it off. The jet seems to be at quite a wide angle - not a problem for me as I'm tall but I wonder how effective it would be if I were nearer the ground and the jets a little further apart. Still, like I said, not a problem for me.\n","\n","When I stopped going to my last gym, it was of course initially due to my own lack of commitment, but the wry looks I'd get from the staff on the occasions I went after not going for a while put me right off even bothering. But I joined this gym back in March of this year; in May I came down with a virus or something, which affected my breathing quite badly, and I couldn't do anything energetic for a couple of months - then it was the Fringe when I worked six days a week - and eventually it ended up being October before I managed to get back there. But when I did - I can't believe I'm saying this about a gym; ME, the sworn cake'n'couch devotee - it was like coming home.\n","before Cafe Class, you funny little corner, you. With your bizarre salsa covers of pop hits like Beat It on the radio, and your oddly cluttered and homely shop floor, you are an oddball of the highest order. I like oddballs.\n","\n","I also like hot chocolate, and if a hot chocolate arrived with a giant chocolate wafer-straw stuck in the mountain of cream - well, I'm going to be a happy lady. Especially if the chappy who brings it over also seems happy, which he does. I like happy people.\n","\n","And yes, if the hot chocolate itself is not the finest, the wafer straw still makes me happy. Nom nom nom. And so does sitting on a tall stool gazing out at a busy Tollcross junction through the plate-glass. I like gazing out of windows.\n","\n","Yes, Cafe Class, I don't love you just yet, but I like you. I like you, Cafe Class.\n","before Having once had a nice piece of cake in Cafe Turquaz, I was looking forward to returning tonight.\n","\n","We were not an easy group; they had very kindly reserved us some space at the back of the long, narrow seating area but as we expanded in number we became harder and harder to fit in. Eventually the very friendly staff member suggested a lengthways rearrangement of the tables, which did the trick very nicely. It was really kind of them to accommodate our hassle!\n","\n","It's a sweet little spot, quite dark (as I remembered) and with teeny weeny Turkish rugs the size of mouse mats on the walls. Cute! But unfortunately there's no real getting around a few issues.\n","\n","The chap didn't seem to really know anything about gluten- free and it took poor Claire L a bit of word wrangling to work out what exactly she was ordering and whether it would suit. He wasn't forthcoming on volunteering a full description of the dish so it took a while. I think he was mostly just confused and caught off guard by an unexpected question.\n","\n","I was excited by the offer of \"steamed milk with a flavour\", which has to be the nicest little thing I read on a menu. So nicely put! I opted for the honey one, but I'd really like to try it again because I was bemused by what tasted like basically just milk until I found all of the honey sitting at the bottom. I suppose it was my fault for not stirring it but steamed milk is so yummy and frothy I hadn't wanted to deflate it.\n","\n","The food looked a little lacklustre and disappointing but I do remember having enjoyed the cake on my first visit, and the Turkish Delight this time was really nice, so I think I'll have to go back and try a third time. I suspect that their strengths lie in the sweet things. I'll update when I've been back and I imagine I shall add a star with the caveat that you come for the sweet side of the menu!\n","before A considerable walk out of town, the Royal Mail Delivery Office is a bit tricky to find. If you haven't got a smartphone with maps, good luck finding it. The turning is labelled \"Scottish Widows printing\" most conspicuously, and if you're heading in the dark (as most people will in darker parts of the year, before or after work) it's easy to miss any signage to the contrary.\n","\n","The Delivery Office is where you go to pick up parcels that have been substituted for the Red Card of Failure and the team that works here is, in short, a joy. They are efficient, helpful and cheery, which given how much flak they must get from cross people who have this or that complaint about the non-delivery of their parcel, is little short of miraculous.\n","\n","The room for parcel collection (\"Customer Enquiries\") is just a small room arranged to hold a queue of maybe about eight people leading up to the counter, which is usually staffed by two people. A chair is available in the corner in case your parcel is taking a while to arrive.\n","\n","Now then. The Red Card of Failure states that they will keep your parcel for 18 days before returning it to sender. It's worth being aware that this includes the day on which delivery was attempted, so when I arrived to collect my parcel today on what I thought was the 17th day, it was in fact the 18th. You'd think that even day 18 of 18 would be acceptable and it would get sent back after the 18 days mentioned on the card were up, but it had already gone on the van to be returned. Frustrating indeed as it was a 40 minute jog for me to get there this evening! However, the chap was deeply apologetic and recognised that there had been a problem at their end, so I think my case of premature return might be an exception. Nonetheless, worth noting..!\n","\n","I also came here on 19 December, when the queue all evening was out the door. My heart sank when I joined the end of that queue but I couldn't believe how fast it moved. I sat there for a while on the chair, wrapping the item that had just been delivered (it was for that night) and observed the queue moving at a consistent pace and the staff never flagged once. Great to see.\n","\n","Final note: at some delivery offices they don't bother asking for your ID before giving the parcel. They do here so make sure you take some along. And your best bet is to arrange redelivery online if you're nearing the end of the 18 day period, just in case!\n","before How lucky, how fortunate we are to live in a city like Edinburgh, and how much more so that it contains something as flawlessly beautiful as Grassmarket.\n","\n","Broad and cobbled, Grassmarket lies glowing in the sun or sparkling in the rain, garlanded about with a bright wreath of independent shops, taverns, and hotels. It's home, too, to a regular market, which fills its central plaza with life and energy. During August, it becomes a hive of activity for those escaping the pressing throngs of the Royal Mile, busy in its own way but retaining a sense of mischief, fun, and self-identity that never quite gets erased by the descent of the hoards.\n","\n","It was a beautiful day last time I sauntered around the Grassmarket area, and since I was early for a meeting I decided to just sit on one of the benches and do some work. To my amazement, there seemed to be an open BT Wifi connection; I'm not sure how stable it is because I tend to hotspot from my phone instead most of the time, rather than using open networks, but still. You could have knocked me down with a feather.\n","\n","Oh, Grassmarket. What an agent of joy you are and shall ever remain.\n","before This teensy little Post Office does a roaring trade due to its super-central location, so don't be surprised if you have to line up outside. It doesn't provide passport forms and the like, so for your official document needs you will have to head elsewhere, but if all you want is a jiffy bag and to post a packet, this'll do you nicely. The staff are pretty perky too, which is jolly nice when you finally reach the front of the line.\n","\n","It gets a bit crowded by the window where there's a writing shelf; if there's more than one person trying to juggle parcels or stick on some newly-purchased stamps prior to sending, elbows will be bound to jog one another. But that's just because the whole place is so weeny and cuuute!\n","before Tucked away on a corner of East Claremont Street sits this cute little oddity. Peopled with cheery staff, furnished with smooth conker-red leather benches and containing a shelf laden with teetering piles of board games, Elbow is the kind of place I'd like to spend a rainy Sunday afternoon after a long walk. There's even an old 2-player arcade game set into a coffee table and surrounded by beanbags. Hooray!\n","\n","We arrived for dinner at around six and were instantly greeted by a perky chap who took our drinks orders and supplied us, somewhat apologetically, with a menu scribbled out on a piece of A4. That might sound a bit rubbish, but the reason was that they were just in the process of switching to the winter menu, so actually we had the excited feeling of previewing something new.\n","\n","I started with the soup of the day - broccoli and cauliflower - which came served in a wonderful tubby pot with a lid to keep it hot and steaming. The bread that came with it (and - hallelujah! - sufficient butter!) was perfection: great hefty chunks toasted to a list crisp on the outside but still warm and fluffy within. The soup was perfect. I normally end up chucking tons of extra salt into things but this was spot on.\n","\n","Next up was the \"catch of the day\" with chips fried in duck fat. We never did get round to asking what kind of fish it was, but it was slightly pungent, meaty in texture and - as we had been warned - enormous! It could have benefitted from a bit of lemon juice but it was otherwise really good. The chips were super-chunky and very solid, so I was totally full by about two thirds of the way through! I'm starting to think I'm losing my touch...\n","\n","The music was slightly louder than I might have liked, and I'm not a fan of televisions in pubs either, but I'm not going to complain too much when for both courses (and the soup could have been a main on its own!) and two lime and sodas, it only cost me £14.45. Overall, it's a cosy and comfortable little spot with good hefty meals I'd happily go back to.\n","before They say that the best thing about Appleton Tower is that when you're inside it, you can't see it. Well, it's true, you can't. But that's far from the best thing, and not at all the main reason that I actually LIKE going there.\n","\n","So what is? Is it the spacious lecture theatres with good equipment, abundant power sockets, smart desks and sufficient legroom even for moi, Mlle Énorme? Is it the airy concourse and cafe area flooded with natural light? Is it the easily navigable layout? Is it the fact that it opens its doors on a regular basis to events for the general public? Is it that every August it performs an admirable job of being Fringe Central, refuge for weary performers, hub for media bees, space for workshops and seminars, treasure map for arts industry professionals?\n","\n","Well, I don't rightly know. But it definitely isn't just not having to gripe about the architecture.\n","before She and I, we have a strange friendship. She invites me into her home on occasion - she never comes to mine. Each time, I am quietened. For example, I will pick up a cushion, and she will casually mention its value. I'll quickly replace it, blushing. \"Sorry,\" I say. \"I'm just... it's really pretty.\"\n","\n","She smiles - laughs actually - not a tinkling, vanishing laugh, but a proper laugh full of sparkle and fun. \"It's fine,\" she says, with a wink. But I've put the cushion back too straight. This is not a house of straightness. As she bends to re-skew it, back to the perfect angle, just so, I notice the way her dress falls. It's elegant. It's quirky. It's colourful. Oh, for a dress like that.\n","\n","The coffee table is laden with enormous books: Berlin. Photography. Seasonal Pies. Spaces... Spaces? They're beautiful, and they don't look like they've ever been opened. They are there to be on the table. The table, likewise, is there to bear their unread weight. A candle in a tin, too, wide, with three wicks, which have never been lit; a fresh, fruity aroma hovers around it all the same.\n","\n","I turn to comment on the beautiful smell but she's pulling on a patchwork apron over her beautiful dress. It messes up her hair a little bit, improves it somehow. \"Let's make a cake!\" she laughs - that laugh again - and pulls me out into the hall by my arm, starting to make for the kitchen. I wonder vaguely if she ought not to perhaps try making one of the Seasonal Pies instead. I nearly trip over a padded fabric doorstop on my way out, a paisley and polka-dot letter \"A\". Ah. Her name stops doors from closing. Of course.\n","\n","\"I'm - I'm sorry,\" I stammer, un-straightening the A, checking it for a mark where I've kicked it. No. Thank goodness. \"Actually, I - I have to be heading off again pretty soon.\" I seem in danger of knocking everything, and yet there's so much room here. Spaces.\n","\n","\"But you never stay!\" she cries, with a playful pout. \"I've got these pecans to use up, you know...\"\n","\n","\"No, really, sorry, I know, ha. Um.\" I shrug. I'm trying now not to be standing on the rug. Has anyone ever stood on this rug? She probably stands slightly above it.\n","\n","\"Oh, spoilsport,\" she grins. \"Ok, off you go then. See you next time, Cressida!\"\n","\n","\"Thanks. Bye. Thanks. Bye, Anthropologie.\"\n","\n","She waves to me from the door, an embroidered oven glove on her hand, as I walk out into the street, holding nothing in mine. Already I regret leaving - already I want to go back in - already I will visit her again. I turn to wave back, but the door has closed.\n","before Delicate chairs in candyfloss hues, tiny model birds in ornate cages, inviting and rotund jars of sweets on the windowsill, and the cakes, oh the cakes, lining the counter with a riot of colour and a promise of delight... This is my kind of place.\n","\n","Arriving a little early for my meeting over the road, I decided to take advantage of the time by finally sampling the delights of Mimi's, and I am so very glad I did. My day has thenceforth proceeded in a smooth, sweet, sugared manner much befitting a Friday.\n","\n","First of all, that raspberry and chocolate brownie. Now that's how you make a brownie! Big, gooey, and packed full of rich, rich flavour, it was the brownie of my dreams. You could probably have used my fork to perform surgery, I licked it so clean. Then there's that pot of Teapigs tea, which was exactly what I needed. I (most unlike me) didn't put sugar in it, because I think I might have had an aneurysm if I had sugar in my tea alongside a brownie like that. And it was a perfect pairing.\n","\n","The only dropped star here is that I would never have expected a brownie and a pot of tea to come to well over five pounds, but given the size - and oh the quality! - of the thing, it's not entirely unreasonable (slightly, but not entirely). I suppose I could say that this dropped star also covers the fact that every time I stood up, my head ended up instead the birdcage, but actually that would be inaccurate as a) it is my fault I am so very very tall like a gangly spangly heron and b) I quite enjoyed the experience and, had I been alone, might have remained there for some minutes singing and pretending to be the misfit giant birdie among all my teeny weeny feathery friends.\n","\n","I might still be a bit high on sugar.\n","before One knows, in general, what to expect from a shopping centre - you've got your high street fashion chains, your low- and mid-market accessory chains (Claire's, Accessorize), your coffee chain, your budget stationery shops, your DVD\\/game store, your chemist, the odd stall of bejewelled phone covers or pashminas or bags or hats... Tick, tick, repeated tick. Oh, and a Poundland, which is always a slightly guilty pleasure.\n","\n","Nevertheless, despite all its generic box-ticking, I actually kind of like St James, certainly more than a number of other centres of its ilk. It's got lots of massage chairs for stressed shoppers to take a break in, for example - although the idea of sitting in a massage chair in public seems odd to me, but there is normally one occupied. It's also got a nice little customer service kiosk to help with general enquiries, which is a sweet touch that I don't think I've seen elsewhere, and also pretty handy as I tend to get lost. What is it about shopping centres that I can never work out the floorplan? Normally I have a pretty fiendish sense of direction but as soon as I'm in a mall my inner compass just goes NOPE.\n","\n","Anyway, if you know what you're looking for and you know where to find it, you'll probably find it in St James. I couldn't locate an iron, mind you, although I probably could have got one from John Lewis, which adjoins the centre rather like a wealthy godfather holding hands with his pleasant yet obviously less privileged charge.\n","before Sweet things.\n","Treat things.\n","Gleamy things.\n","Creamy things.\n","Things that crumble. Things that puff.\n","Sprinkly things and glistening stuff.\n","Pastries, cakes and horns of cream.\n","Pinch me. OW. It's not a dream.\n","\n","The only reason I don't come in here ALL THE TIME is because, frankly, I'm terrified of the staff. I can't understand how someone can be surrounded by so much yumminess all the time and yet be so sad. Perhaps it is because they don't get to eat all the lovely things while they're on duty...\n","\n","However, they are artists. Their creations are beautiful. They made the 3rd birthday cake for Yelp and it was incredible. I just had a cream horn and it was ENORMOUS, crispy, sweet, fluffy and only £1.05. They can make cakes to spec, including gluten free, ice them with a custom image for just an extra £4, and all sorts of delicious options. They are cakey royalty.\n","before From the moment I walked through the entrance, I was... Entranced. Punny but true. Larger than I expected, and darker, more romantic, was this beehive around which there had been such buzz. There was beautiful, unusual art on the far wall, and fairy lights twisted around the mantel above the warm electric fire. Behind me, a vast blackboard proclaimed the day's specials in proud lettering, and the staff bid me a friendly hello as I pranced past, a spring already in my step.\n","\n","So the setting was a joy. The company, as with all Yelpy get togethers, equally so. All that remained was to sample the food.\n","\n","Well, you can see from the rating just how that turned out. For a starter I tried the day's vegetarian special, the roasted mushrooms with garlic and melted taleggio. I tell you, I would happily come back for that dish alone, but the free range chicken supreme with cream cheese, ham hock, bacon, and mustard and veal jus on smoky potatoes maintained the flavour explosion. The final master stroke - a clementine and butterscotch mess presented like a knickerbocker glory topped with a glacé cherry - was fiendishly good.\n","\n","When you add to all of this how close it is to the Queen's Hall, my favourite venue in Edinburgh, and the fact that they have a two-course deal if you're early enough to vacate by seven, and you have one place I am very, very likely to return to many times...\n","before Yes, friends, sometimes I go to Starbucks in search of wifi. I feel much better about sitting for hours on end with one £2 cup of tea on Starbucks' dime than anyone else's - I would get the guilt if I did it to anybody else!\n","\n","But today I genuinely had to double-check. Was I checking in to the right Starbucks? This beautiful, cleverly-laid-out glass-fronted cafe, this cunning mezzanine circled with padded benches... this was the two-star hound that peered piteously up from the cold glare of my iPhone screen? Surely not... and yet, and yet, and yet.\n","\n","The staff were smart and efficient - the second a queue began to form behind me (what can I say, I'm a magnetic presence) one of the baristas hopped out and started taking orders, making the quick ones right there on the spot, so by the time the transaction ahead of me was complete, my cup of mint tea was sitting there right next to the till to be pushed my way at the point of payment. SMART.\n","\n","Toddling up the little wooden stairs to the upper layer of the store (which I just love how they've done that, by the way) I settled myself by a table on a nice squidgy bench - I really do like a nice squidgy bench - and sat for a while admiring the view onto Hanover Street (and, ahem, of the attractive gentleman working industriously in the opposite corner, ahem).\n","\n","My experience of this branch is so far removed from others' that I was seriously on the point of giving it five stars - it loses one only for the state of the toilets, which were mildly shambolic. Clean, but cluttered and cramped.\n","before Favorit left me underwhelmed. We came here for Book Club in December and I suffer from a terrible affliction of being unable to resist ordering food if the possibility of doing so is raised, so order I did. It seemed a good opportunity at the very least to continue my search for Edinburgh's Greatest Eggs Benedict.\n","\n","Well, that plan got scuppered pretty quickly when the waiter returned saying that they'd run out of Benedict Sauce. This told me two things: they don't make it fresh, and they don't know what it's called... so I am slightly glad I didn't experiment...\n","\n","Anyway, I plumped instead for a salmon and cream cheese bagel and a pot of tea. The bagel was just fine. I could have bought the ingredients and made one for myself just as well for about a third of the price, but it was tasty and the bagel bread was nice and sweet, as it should be, with cheese squidging out of the centre hole. No criticisms there really.\n","\n","The teapot, however, was badly chipped and stained right on the pouring edge of the spout. Being a timid Brit, I grinned and bore it, but it was pretty offputting.\n","\n","Favorit's a diner-style caff, and it made a decent enough venue for our reduced numbers at Book Club, but it's nothing special. Situated where it is, I'd have thought it'd have to play a better game to get by. Come on, Favorit! I'll definitely come back to see if they're working on it!\n","before I was unprepared for this. UNPREPARED. Beautiful lasagne, colourful and flavoury salads (shut up, flavoury is totally a word) and a chap playing such soul drenchingly gorgeous jazz piano that I had to stop eating on three separate occasions because it took away my ability to do anything but sit and attempt to breathe.\n","\n","The lasagne, being (naturally) vegetarian, was almost more like a moussaka, and so delicious that I wanted about eight of them. I suddenly understood why the chap I ordered from had repeated my order back to me as \"one lasagne?\" But any more, along with the two included salads, might have destroyed me, particularly as I planned to sample one of the exquisite looking cakes, for which I barely had room after those delicious lasagnery salady exploits. I reckon five star lasagne with a choice of two out of nine salads for just £7.50 is a damn good deal.\n","\n","I then, as planned, proceeded to the cakery. The cakes aren't labelled, so I asked the girl what each cake was and she had fun matching the names on a list to what they looked like. I opted for the chocolate and lemon, topped with physalis, because it looked dinky compared to the others. Ha - WRONG! It was dinky in size only, but denser than a singularity and rich, rich, rich. A little dry by nature, it was served with a whole glass dish of lemon curd for my ladling pleasure. Ogh. I think I shall never move again, my friends.\n","\n","Dark wood tables, a sofa at the far end, stone vault ceilings... It's a wrong wrong miracle that this place was relatively quiet when I appeared on a Tuesday afternoon, admittedly a little after the traditional lunchtime. I'm torn between wanting it to be as packed as it deserves to be and wanting to keep it as mine, my own, my precious, for all time. Because did I mention the free wifi? Oh, I didn't? Well I have now.\n","\n","What twig? Oh, this twig. No, no, never you mind, no, this twig is, uh, just, er, well I am definitely not building a nest here, that's definitely not what I am doing, ahaha haha ha...\n","before My grandad lives in a farmhouse in Wales. Everything is very rustic there - you know, lots of jute and heavy woollen jumpers and stuff. He has a ceramics workshop out the back where I'm told he throws pots (always nice to have a special place to go when you get that cross, I suppose). He turns wooden things as well (so they face the right way, perhaps) and eats rye bread and there's a rickety old bench next to the log pile outside. His wife bakes really good marmalade cakes and the hot chocolate is never quite as sweet as you think it will be. It is very much like Artisan Roast on Broughton Street.\n","\n","I, as some reviewers have also confessed, am not by any means a coffee connoisseur, so I felt a bit of a fraud coming here in some ways. I'm not the target demographic. But come I did, and Yelp I do, so review I shall. Yoda I am apparently becoming.\n","\n","The hot chocolate varieties are unprecedented in my experience - lavender, rose and black pepper, and another which I can't recall. Being fan of roses as much as, if not more than, of ribbons, I'm surprised I went for lavender, but there we go. It was... exactly as you might expect lavender-flavoured hot chocolate to taste: not very sweet, but rather a faint hint of chocolate spiced up with that kind of pungent floral kick. I've got to say, it didn't work perfectly for me and it was a bit gritty at the bottom, but as an experiment it was quite fun and I wouldn't advise against it.\n","\n","What *really* didn't work for me was the space - I felt cramped and I had to keep shuffling my chair closer into the table to let people past. I was beside the wall, rather than sticking out into the room, so I'm not entirely sure what was going on there. The serving staff took a long time to notice me - takeaway customers were being prioritised and a fair number of people entered, queued, got served and left in the time that I was at my table waiting. This also happened to my friend who joined me later. I'm not sure if you're meant to just go up and grab somebody (there's no actual counter) but it wasn't clear.\n","\n","As a side note, there's a sign by the door that says \"J K Rowling never wrote here\". That really made me laugh.\n","before I came here today for lunch with Tanya L, at her recommendation, and first I have to say - thanks, Tanya! What a lovely place! As you all know, I'm a big fan of the Festival Theatre both as an arts venue and just as a building in general, so I was already pretty sure I'd like the light and space that I could see from outside was a feature of Th'eatery, and I do love a good punny name.\n","\n","The food, however, was not a done deal ahead of time. The proof of the pudding (or quiche) is in the eating, as they say, and food at theatres can often be a little hastily compiled and dodgy (yes, I'm looking at you, West Yorkshire Playhouse). Not so at Th'eatery! The soup and quiche options change daily and we're looking at less than four quid for soup and bread, which is darned good.\n","\n","Tanya and I opted for one portion of quiche to share - today's quiche was salmon - and a Classic Board, which includes buffalo mozzarella, ciabatta, a dish of pesto, a big pile o' olives, sliced tomatoes, and various leafy things. Some olive oil was also brought across for us in a cute little old-fashioned oil-can, which I loved.\n","\n","I adore quiche but often find the pastry a bit of a letdown - again, not so at Th'eatery! The pastry was great; crisp and flavoursome. I wouldn't normally opt for a fish quiche but the salmon was a really nice flavour in with the fresh egg filling, which was soft and came apart easily - though not so easily that it was impossible to divide the slice in half - just right.\n","\n","The sharing board was very nice, too. It was tricky to separate the pieces of ham from one another as they were all kind of plopped together on the board but that's a very minor point. The ciabatta was lovely, fluffy and crispy, and with a bit of mozzarella and pesto it made for a few very lovely mouthfuls. I think if we hadn't ordered the quiche as well I might have been still a little hungry at the end but what we had was just right.\n","\n","The service was super-jolly, too! Such a nice chap, and he recognised Tanya from having been in before, which is always a good thing. It was quiet in there when we arrived but more people were appearing as we got further through our meal and the service didn't decline in standard at all. What a great addition to an already fabulous theatre.\n","before Come on. Seriously. This is crazy. EVERYTHING here is fabulous. The dizzyingly high ceilings, the splendid sense of opulence without ostentation, the chirpy serving staff, the hot ch... hot ch... hot... cho... sorry, I went off into a little dreamland for a moment there. What was I saying? Oh, yes, the hot chocolate! Thick, rich, dark hot chocolate to slide into your tummy on a cold winter's day... Mmmm...\n","\n","It also plays host to the legendary weekly #EdCM gathering of techy types and social-savvy supergeeks from all over Edinburgh on a Friday morning, the space, light and sheer class of the place perfectly suited to the event.\n","\n","And finally, there's the toilet arrangement, which is just too much fun to believe. Setting aside for a moment the super-swish decor in that downstairs defecatory dominion, let's talk about the audio situation. Or should I say, let's talk about coffee. Because down in the toilets, you can learn conversational Italian - I can now ask for a coffee with milk, thanks to Centotre's toilet tutelage. But beware. I also spent so long just sitting there saying \"con leche\" to the stall door that everyone had left by the time I got back up. How do you say \"oops\" in Italian?\n","before What a tremendously civilised little spot this is! Elegant and sweet, with lovely teal and fuchsia chairs, it's a charming place to get your tea fix.\n","\n","And tea fix you will get. Their A4 menu has over two pages devoted to tea, tea, and more tea. I can't wait to come back another time when I can really take the opportunity to browse all of the teas on offer; Alisa R and I arrived shortly before closing time so we hurried on and ordered quickly.\n","\n","I have only very recently discovered the chai latte so I ordered one of those, and we scuttled over to the counter to see what the cakes looked like. The cupcakes were on the little side, and being the greedy guts that I am, I was swayed by the huge blocks of millionaire's shortcake. Alisa went for the yummy-sounding chocolate and beet root cake, which wasn't pre-cut, but when the slice arrived it was super generous too!\n","\n","I think the chai lattes I have had since discovering it have been the quick and easy versions made with powder or syrup, but that is not the Eteaket way. This one was, of course, made with Proper Tea, so it tasted thinner and less sweet, but more sophisticated.\n","\n","My shortcake was very good; it was solid and held its form well, with rich chocolate and thick caramel. I did wish I had gone with Alisa's choice though because it was completely amazing when I tried a bit.\n","\n","The staff were really sweet and friendly, and quick to serve, although we were the only people there so late in the day so I can't speak for busier times... Yet! But I'll be back!\n","before Fondue?! Count me in!\" That was the message that shot back immediately when I texted my friend mentioning Juniper's Fondue Fridays. I'd heard great things about the cocktails at this new pad but that wasn't a massive pull for me. But fondue - well, that's another matter entirely.\n","\n","Hopping up the first flight of stairs just inside the Royal British Hotel, we arrived at the trendy and swish bar to be greeted by a cheery staff member. Plush purple sofa-benches, flowers in pink water on the tables, space-age egg-chairs, and cool textured wallpaper make Juniper a cool and sophisticated take on the cocktail bar. The music (funky stuff - Justin Timberlake, Michael Jackson and so on) worked very well with the feel of the place although it could have done with being a fraction quieter. It was quite early in the evening and not that busy but we were having to raise our voices to talk. Nevertheless, it was super-suave - a far cry from our \"usual\" type of place but very impressive and enjoyable.\n","\n","There were two choices of both savoury and sweet fondue that night; we went for cider, cheese and bacon, which arrived pretty quickly with a lovely board of dunkables: salmon, mussels, herby chicken, tender beef steak and raw carrot sticks. Heaven! We didn't have that problem that so often occurs with fondue, when you run out of dippy bits before you run out of fondue to dip into. It was superb, and at £16 for both of us together, a pretty cheap way to dine out. We were certainly too full to indulge in a sweet fondue to follow, so that'll have to be a separate trip... oh, so I have to go back? Fine by me!\n","\n","As I said, it wasn't that busy. Even though it was early that evening (we were there just before six and stayed until around eight), it definitely deserves to pack out quickly. Hopefully as word spreads, it'll become a regular go-to spot after work for lots of people.\n","before Off the Mile and up some stairs, this rather pleasant room hides away from the busy streets behind old arched casements.\n","\n","When Moray L suggested we come here for a catch-up dinner, I looked it up here on Yelp and was a little apprehensive based on the other reviews. But hey, what's life if you don't take a risk now and then?\n","\n","Well, I'm kind of glad we did. The place itself is rather spacious and very comfortable, with low lighting (they bring up the lights a little brighter over an occupied table, which is quite snazzy) - altogether quite pleasing, especially on a cold, rainy December night. One touch that really doesn't work, though, is a large digital clock with red numbers - even counting the seconds - which \"chimes\" the hour every 30 minutes. It's a little disruptive, not to mention slightly apocalyptic.\n","\n","Now then, when it comes to curries, I love chicken korma. I mean I really love it. I don't choose it because I can't handle spice (I can) or because I don't like the unfamiliar (I do) but just because I really, really love it. But normally, I feel cowed, worried that I will be judged as a pleb, so I order something else instead. Of course, I always enjoy my food; I don't order to spite myself. However, sometimes I just long for that creamy rich korma... Well, this was the day! Defiantly, I decided to navigate with determination to the korma, through an impressively extensive menu - the second half of the menu is Indian; the first half, it claims, is Thai - I'm no expert in Thai so can't comment on the remarks in previous reviews that it lacks authenticity. Moray L was certainly looking forward to her meal at least, having eaten there before, and promising me that the sweet potato fritters were \"the best thing ever!\"\n","\n","The sauces that arrived with our poppodums were a little lacklustre and I think they might have come out of bottles, but they were fine. Our waiter, on the other hand, did not seem fine. I don't know whether he'd just had some terrible news, or was just having a really bad day, but he walked everywhere at half speed like he'd rather be anywhere else and never cracked a smile once. It wasn't busy in there (about three or four tables including us), but it seemed to take forever to get anything done and after our first drinks he didn't come back to offer us more at any point.\n","\n","Moray was right, by the way: those fritters really are quite something. As I said, I can't vouch for their Thai authenticity but I don't really care. I just want to eat them all. My korma, too, was lovely - perhaps there wasn't as much as I might have hoped for, but maybe I've been spoiled in the past. It was just fine - not the best I've had, but not disappointing either, and hit the spot nicely. I'd ordered lemon rice to go with it, and it was super-lemony (hooray!), which gave a nice kick to the creaminess of the korma.\n","\n","Our bill came to just under £40 and, well, here's a useful thing - if you're going Dutch, they handily present the total per person (as divided equally) beneath the main total. Assuming you've ordered roughly the same amount, this means no more faffing around working it out!\n","\n","It feels like more than three stars, it really does, but just doesn't quite warrant four. But anyway, despite the Clock Of Doom (perhaps explaining the Waiter Of Misery) I'd come back here again happily for a nice cosy meal on a winter's evening.\n","before CC Blooms, besides its main function as a host of scene club nights, is practically next door to the Playhouse and therefore ideally situated to serve a pre-show dinner menu to musical theatre enthusiasts. I'm aware that later in the evening it becomes an altogether different affair but since it also puts itself out there offering a pre-show dinner option we went for it. At £8 for two courses, how could we refuse?\n","\n","After I'd surprised my brother by waving a ticket to the Lion King in his face - thereby placing myself strongly in the running for the Sister Of The Year award - we decided to hop along there early and toast my award nomination with dinner. And, friends, it grieves me to report a slight fault in the proceedings...\n","\n","The seriously cheap dinner deal offered on the blackboard outside was what had tempted us in, and the carrot and coriander soup starter was, admittedly, decent enough, served in a sweet little pot with nice bread on the side. However, it all fell apart when the mains arrived. I had spinach and ricotta ravioli, which normally gets me very excited  - but alas, I found that it was little different from something I could have bought from Tesco and blasted to temperature in my own miniature domestic radiation chamber. The waiter appeared little more energised by the whole process than the poor old pasta did and I can't blame him as the place was almost completely dead. Those of you who read my reviews frequently will know to fling your hands up in dramatic sympathy when I say this: we didn't stick around for dessert. *sigh* Yes, that Sister award might be slipping through my fingers...\n","\n","I'm sure this place is mighty fine at its primary objective, but they've got a nice place and a great location and so they could be doing a lot more to make the most of opportunities earlier in the evening.\n","\n","Closing irrelevant-yet-interesting fact: it's named for Bette Midler's character in Beaches, Cecilia Carol Bloom. Did you ever know..?\n","before I had a really lovely lunch here - but I think that, had my company not been so splendid, I wouldn't have had such a good time. This place seems confused about whether it's a classy restaurant or a kooky indie eatery. In support of the former: it's elegant, spacious, and served us each an intimidatingly large glass on arrival with the wide base of its bowl moistened with a finger of white wine - complimentary, apparently, although it was just kind of plonked in front of me and I had no idea whether I'd be charged but was too English to ask. (Also \"plonk\" might be entirely the wrong word. I don't know, for obvious reasons!).\n","\n","In support of the latter: it has a wide range of clocks on the walls, all stopped at somewhere kind of afternoonish time, so don't trust them if you're out for lunch. I know, I get it, \"tempo perso\" and all that, but it just seemed a little like trying too hard. There's also this weird screen showing some kind of cookery programme, to which, fortunately, I had my back, or I would have been utterly distracted.\n","\n","That said - the food was pleasant - we simply ordered three dishes from the antipasti part of the menu to share between us as a light bite and they were pretty nice, all around the £6 mark. I'm not sure I'd have necessarily seen fit to charge that much for the mushrooms or the bruschetta trio (£2 for each wee bit of bruschetta? Cheeky). I guess when the mains are hitting into the teens price-wise it's to be expected, though. The trio of bruschetta was excellent, however. The roasted vegetable one was my favourite.\n","\n","For me, it's not quite settled enough to be a treat meal out, and it's not quite kooky enough to be characterful; I guess most of the competition in the immediate vicinity seems to be coffee shops and patisseries, though, so it serves a purpose and if you've got the budget for a full meal sometime in the evening when there's more atmosphere then I'm sure you'll have a fine time.\n","before I met up with Emma W for coffee here and was pretty impressed with the space. It's larger than I expected and contains, along with the tables and chairs, a tipi (accompanied by a charming sign that reads \"No food in the tipi pretty please\"). How thoroughly splendid! The two chairs formed from single pieces of wood polished to a gleam are a real highlight too - very lovely.\n","\n","I had a hot chocolate (standard!) and one of the brownies. The brownie was £1.50 and dense as dense could be, but gooey and rich. Delicious! In some ways it was more like fridge cake than brownie, because there wasn't much that was a bit cakey about the texture at all, but it was yumtastic nonetheless. The hot chocolate was fine and came in a nice glass (I love a hot chocolate in a glass).\n","\n","I think Area C is still settling into itself, so I'll be going back to update in a few weeks. The owner was a little distracted, engaged in creating menu boards, and seemed somewhat uncertain of what kind of setup the cafe is aiming for (pay on purchase or on departure, he just sort of shrugged) but I'm sure those are just teething problems. There was also a slight spillage of coffee on delivery, which wasn't accompanied by an apology or an attempt to clean up - again, I suspect due to being a little distracted by the primary task in hand. Menu boards are a v useful thing to have, especially when, as today, the chap can't seem to remember the prices of things! It was really nice to see them hanging over the counter by the time we left and I'm looking forward to coming back. I have a feeling this place is going to be pretty lovely when it's all sorted out.\n","before Ahh, Cockburn Street, my picturesquely twisting friend, what delights you hold!\n","\n","Cockburn Street is pretty much top of my list for present shopping, due to its abundance of cute'n'kooky little shops. It's just the right side of sketchy - some of its establishments look a little seedy but in a colourful and good-natured manner, while others are cute and bubbly.\n","\n","As a street, it's a real picture. Old, cobbled, and winding in a tight curl from High Street to Market Street, walking down it feels like scooting down a shop-lined version of Moonface's Slippery Slip in the Magic Faraway Tree books. Dark closes challenge you with endless steps to left and right, where if you just pick one randomly, you might find a shortcut, or you might add several minutes and a potential cardiac arrest to your journey.\n","\n","It's also one of the streets that gets gritted in snowy conditions so it's among the less perilous of the Old Town's winter attractions.\n","before When Blythe told me he'd checked out a new spot that he thought that I, in particular, would really like, I got quite excited and resolved to toddle along as soon as I could.\n","\n","Oh Blythe. You were right, my friend.\n","\n","Dinky as a daisy and blue as a cornflower, I can criticise this little joy in one way only - that it isn't nearer to my house. Their \"soup and half sandwich\" deal for £4.95 is pretty breath-taking - if that's HALF a sandwich, I don't wanna see a full one! You can choose the bread type for your butty as well - I went with a tiger baguette filled with chilli chicken mayo and yippity-yum was I glad that I did. Good hearty soup to go with it, too, oh yes indeedy. That, along with a generous pot of tea, hit the spot for £7.15, which I reckon is pretty darned good going.\n","\n","They also, as Blythe and Julie both mentioned, do Tennessee buttermilk pancakes (ZZZZZIP) so I will be back ere long to have a chompy brekkist here as well.\n","\n","The menu is presented on a clipboard and the wall is adorned with the simple but rather effective conceit of spelling the name of the cafe in large letters, each printed on A4, popped on a clipboard and stuck to the wall. The only other piece of decoration on the wall is an adorable poster for the cafe's Tennessee namesake, the famous acoustic music club.\n","\n","Disclosure: I have never been the kind of person who has a yen to travel. Tennessee, however, is one of the only places in the world I have ever actually wanted to go to. And now I feel like I can trot on down there for pancakes any day of the week.\n","before We were sitting right next to the entrance, and the howling page boys of Storm Emily were rolling out a red carpet of dead leaves ahead of her arrival, pushing as many through the revolving door as they possibly could. Perhaps it was the Bloody Vintages and espresso liqueurs, perhaps it was Christmas cheer, or perhaps it was just that the place is generally pretty cosy, but somehow the Yelpers brunching within remained warm and snug despite the elements.\n","\n","The talk, once we'd settled on The Vintage as our destination, had been all of gypsy eggs. The menu just said: gypsy eggs. No explanation, no elaboration, just... gypsy eggs. The curiosities of many were piqued (though clearly not sufficiently to Google). So it was that, despite our waitress Katie reciting a mind-boggling, mouth-watering, eye-popping range of specials and grazing options, more than half of us still put forward our order for the mysterious travelling ova.\n","\n","There was also some discussion of a coffee laced with Mozart white chocolate liqueur. Amazing! Were it not for the fact that I don't drink a) coffee or b) alcohol, that would have been top of my list. It sounded awesome.\n","\n","And then came the gypsy eeeeeggs. *angelic choir noise* Served in a skillet atop an attractive dark wooden board (which also bore a single piece of bread), these are baked eggs in a rich tomato sauce with butter beans and chorizo. Yep. They were absolutely as delicious as they sound. With the recent addition of a teeny Le Creuset skillet-for-one to my kitchen, courtesy of Bro F, I have vowed to attempt to reproduce these marvels for myself.\n","\n","It's impressive that, despite a good capacity and high ceilings (high enough that a Christmas tree was perching comfortably above the door without having to duck), The Vintage retains so much intimacy and character. It's worth being aware though that as it's devoted to a more exclusive, artisan approach to its bar-stock, you might not find some of the spirits and liqueurs you'd get easily elsewhere. Not a problem for one such as me who just wants a pot of tea and an OJ, mind you...\n","\n","A special note here must go to Katie, who was so much that was excellent about our visit. Witty, warm, and with a pretty epic singing voice, she whizzed effortlessly between tables in the ever-more-busy eatery, taking and delivering orders and wisecracking smoothly with customers. She even found time to jolly our whole table into a rowdy group rendition of Rudolph The Red-Nosed Reindeer, though none of us was quite able to match her pipes in anything more than enthusiasm. Bravo, ma'am - you'll go down in his-tor-yyy!\n","before It seems mad to say that shops that are run entirely on customer donations often have individual styles, but it's true. The charity shop family is well-defined in my mind. There's the older lady in lemon crimplene with porcelain horses on her mantelpiece. There's her nephew in denim and his wife in a floral shift dress. There are the cool students in jackets, jeans and boots, listening to vinyls.\n","\n","Then there's Shelter on Nicolson Street, their renegade 90s grunge-mix rebel cousin. She wears a man's leather jacket five sizes too large over a flamenco dress. In her lace-cuffed socks, Doc Martens, and fluorescent beads, she mooches along the street listening to Garbage.\n","\n","Though charity shops in general are experiencing something of a rebirth with the vintage revolution, Shelter seems to be treading its own path. Rather than the space and carefully-arranged rails of many of its relatives, when I walked in it was cramped, chaotic, and colourful. I found a mad garment in there, which I could only assume was, once upon a time, worn by a pantomime dame, and which refused utterly to stay still in my hands but turned itself over, ruffle over ruffle, until I had no idea what I was holding. If I'd even known to begin with. \n","\n","The whole experience was a bewildering joy. One of my most fun moments in the day is staring at the wardrobe in the morning and figuring out what to do with myself today. I've found a new go-to place to spark up those moments. I didn't find what I was looking for, but I found a dressing-up box I didn't want to leave.\n","before What do you want from a sandwich shop? Well, if you can start with a love of sandwiches, it's a good sign. Caffe Espresso - Bingo.\n","\n","The \"Number 9\" baguette has long been legendary in my workplace and so I toddled in with high expectations. When the lady before me ordered something simple, the man behind the counter served her with cheery mock-disapproval, claiming that the order was not a sufficient challenge. When I then asked for the legendary Number 9, he lit up. \"The Number 9? That's my BABY!\" he declared in delight, and immediately set about compiling its various delicious ingredients for me (grilled chicken, taco sauce, cheese, rocket and jalapeños).\n","\n","I don't know about you, but for me, a fellow who can talk so passionately about a sandwich is definitely the person I want making my lunch.\n","\n","His infectious enthusiasm led me to explain that this was my first sampling of the legendary Number 9, and his mood elevated still further. \"It'll change you,\" he promised, and began explaining the spiciness options. I pondered a moment over Entry-Level or Smokin'. \"You know what,\" he continued, \"I'll do you a half-and-half if you like!\"\n","\n","Oh, I do. I do like. Thank you.\n","\n","I had a moment at this point to glance around the weeny shop - about the size of my bedroom, the walls covered in boards reciting the most mouthwatering sandwich combinations imaginable and some pretty spectacular-sounding smoothies. It's homely, colourful and cheerful, with even a tiny bit of space to sit and eat if you can't bear to take your sandwich away from its birthplace.\n","\n","For less than £5, I was - as promised - lifted to a higher plane of sandwichness. Another previously Un-Number-Nined colleague, beholding my delight as I returned to my desk consuming the legend, ran straight out to get one for herself and found herself equally transported. \n","\n","I don't think I've ever been so overwhelmed with joy by a mere baguette; while the enthusiastic service and jolly establishment go a long way toward this score, the proof of the sandwich shop is in the sandwich. The baguette: warm, crusty and soft. The filling: rich and perfectly balanced. Don't expect to eat it elegantly, though; there's a lot stuffed into that baguette and it tends to behave with the same wild exuberance as its creator.\n","\n","I can't wait to try the rest of the options on offer, and some of those amazing-sounding smoothies. Until then... this has been a YUMinator review, starring Sarnie Schwarzenegger. And believe me, Caffe Espresso: I'LL BE BACK.\n","before This one goes out to my former colleagues at the Fringe Society!\n","\n","I have been going on about this shop for no short period of time; every time I have ever bimbled past, I have gazed longingly at their pretty, pretty dresses - every dress the kind that seems to fit and flatter - cleavage-flaunting, waist-cinching, cute'n'girly dresses with plenty of fabric in the skirt.\n","\n","So when I left my job at the Fringe Society to join the wonderful world of Yelp, my super-perceptive colleagues presented me (among other things) with a voucher for Cookie. Bless you, Fringers. Bless you.\n","\n","What with one thing and another, though, it's taken me until now to actually redeem it. (One thing being accidentally leaving it in Yorkshire; another being not having time to shop; a final being that on four - count them - FOUR separate occasions I have gone all the way there only to realise I've left the voucher at home)\n","\n","BUT AT LAST, THIS WAS THE WEEK.\n","\n","What can I say? The dresses aren't cheap - most of them come in around the £70 mark - but they're good-quality, fully-lined, well-fitting and made in nice, soft fabrics. There's also a heck of a range in here. I tried on a good few dresses, and sadly the one I liked best, a bright red one with little white dots, wasn't available in a 10, but its navy blue equivalent was and so KABOOM. I am kitted out for my trip to San Francisco. Look out, California, Polka-Dot Cressi is coming, and she's got a damn fine dress. Thank you, Fringe-folk. I am a the happiest spotted CM you ever did see.\n","before I flitted my way to the Dragonfly for the Cocktail Quest UYE this week, and was surprised to find, once inside, that there weren't many dragonflies to be seen anywhere in the décor. I'd been expecting flashes of blue and green, delicate lacy wings... maybe I was being too literal: it's certainly colourful and exotic, with a richly patterned mix of wallpapers. There was also a definite *buzz* about the inaugural night of the Quest, so that's enough dwelling on insect references! (Tigers actually seemed to be the order of the day - I befriended a porcelain tiger who looked rather cross, but perhaps he had just had one too many.)\n","\n","I love the menus; the covers are made from old vinyl records cut into squares, which is very cool, and what contents! As with all good cocktail menus, there are some cracking names (Raspberry Berry: The Cocktail Formerly Known as Prince) and some delicious-sounding mixes. I was a bit disappointed not to find a page for the harmless stuff and the super-efficient bar staff seemed to boggle slightly at the concept when I asked, but when they realized they had free rein to create anything they liked for me they threw themselves into it with gusto! \n","\n","Mocktail number one was shortly presented to me: a splendid raspberry juice potion with a lovely fresh kick from crushed mint leaves, which stopped it from being too sweet and made it very refreshing and refined. I think I detected maybe some watermelon in there too, but I could be wrong. Mocktail number two, a little while later, was a tropical hit: totally different, very rich, but equally delicious. In fact, it was so nice that after I'd passed it round for my table to try, one of the yelpers ran straight to the bar and asked for \"whatever you made for her\" (with a bit of alcohol too, please).\n","\n","For want of a menu, I am going to name these drinks the Berry-Mint Merriment and the Meg Ryan (as in \"I'll have what she's having\"). That is, of course, purely for myself, because if I go back in and ask for that, I will get an even blanker look, I think...\n","\n","It was a lovely evening and I did enjoy my surprising ad hoc concoctions (adhoctions?) but it's a shame that the upstairs was booked already; even on a Wednesday night it was very full and felt a little cramped. But then, maybe that's only to be expected when a hoard of questing yelpers descend in search of cocktail bliss!\n","before My brother flung the door open with a flourish and strode in. \"I'M TAKING YOU OUT FOR TURKISH,\" he announced. Bro, I am so there.\n","\n","\"There\" was a little spot in Newington, huddling glumly in the blackness of a wet November night. No glumness was within, however: we were seated with jovial alacrity by the window, with some upbeat discussion of the view (sky water falling on road water, and some road water attempting in hissing salmon jumps to go back up to being sky water).\n","\n","Seated in the dimness of almost total candlelight with the occasional orange flare of flame from the kitchen beside us, we were given a tour of the heating options (overhead and under the table). They brought us a little battery-powered lamp while we browsed the menu - such a thoughtful and cute touch.\n","\n","We ordered three meze to start us off - herring salad, squid and walnut salad, and honeydew melon with feta cheese. Woah. The herring was deliciously sweet, fresh and syrupy; the squid had clearly at some point in its recent past actually been a squid, and the honeydew... hoooooooooo. I was expecting a couple of delicate slices but we were given a great bowl full of melony chunks and a goodly wadge of feta unexpectedly topped with mint, which was a lovely touch.  These three dishes alone were almost enough but we decided to get some mains as well since it was so good!\n","\n","For Bro, grilled lamb. For Sis, vegetable moussaka. I'm told the lamb was awesome. As for my moussaka - well, I'm used to moussaka being something of a slop. A tasty slop, but slop nonetheless. This, however, had not only flavour but form and texture. It cut in neat slices and was quite the revelation - absolutely delicious. We rounded it all off with some gorgeous sticky baklava too, and the whole bill - illuminated by the return of the little battery-lamp - came to £50. Amazing.\n","\n","We sat there for a pretty long time waiting for the downpour to abate and never once felt rushed or like the staff were waiting for us to go. Once the sky water had finally all become road water, we left feeling about three stone heavier, but a fresh and healthy weight rather than just a lump of stodge. This was a meal I'll remember for a long time. Nonetheless, I might feel compelled before long to, er... refresh my memory...\n","before Would it be too obvious to say that Looking Glass Books is... a wonderland? I think this is my spiritual home. It's got everything I need. Chess tables. (I have pieces, but no board). Shiny floor. Books. Macarons. Wi-Fi. WHITE HOT CHOCOLATE. The only negative part of coming here was feeling myself shrivel into a raisin of regret at not having come before.\n","\n","The books on offer are varied and eclectic, so if you're looking for something specific rather than just Looking For A Book, finding it here might be tricky. But to that end, they have a Super Fast Ordering Service so you can still avoid the foul trenches of the corporate giants if you're not needing it in your grubby mitt right away.\n","\n","Also, white hot chocolate. I'm returning to this point because it's important. And the fluffiest, flavouriest crumbly passionfruit macaron this side of town (probably). It's tall and igneous-looking, not like its smooth-shelled cousins, delicacies of Laduree so on, and bursts with flavour in your mouth in just the way a good weeny treat ought.\n","\n","Oh, Looking Glass, I find a better version of myself in thee...\n","before I hopped in here on my way past yesterday to post a couple of letters. Yes, not even parcels. One was for New York, so not your standard stampage, and I wasn't sure the other still counted as \"Letter\" as it was quite thick (17 pages. I ramble. You know that.)\n","\n","I wombled in at lunchtime and was surprised by how short the queue was. I'd thought that somewhere this central would be jam-packed, especially at lunchtime, but not so, and the queue was moving along at a fair lick, so kudos to the folks at the windows.\n","\n","I, however, poor soul that I am, fished out my envelopes and was instantly barked at by a lady on patrol. \"STAMPS? YOU WANT STAMPS?\" - and she hustled me out of line. There's an express queue for postage, it seems, of which I was unaware; my regular post office is the one on St Mary's Street - infinitely more compact and manual - so I wasn't used to the idea. Oh, provincial me. It was helpful of her, but she was also slightly alarming and officious in her manner, which kind of made me want to take these lengthy epistles, toils and spoils of my aching hand and brain, and run for the wind. \"I won't let her hurt you,\" I would whisper as we fled down to the shore... But fortunately, reason prevailed, and I was swiftly served with the correct postage. A point here and there at the card machine and she bustled off to find somebody else.\n","\n","I feel a warm fuzziness about post offices not dissimilar to that which I feel about Christmas, and so I wasn't equipped to deal with this mild intimidation. Trying to claw back some of that festive posty spirit, I pulled my international stamp for the New York missive out of the machine, and bounced excitedly. I'm no avid philatelist but I do love to see a pretty stamp with a picture on it. \"Look, it's all colourful and pretty!\" I squeaked to the customer at that moment replacing me at the machine, and pointed at my picturesque postage stamp. I was met with a derisive stare. Oh. Not that kind of post office then.\n","\n","Still, it was light, it was quiet, and I got everything done quickly that I needed to do. I wouldn't avoid it if I were nearby, but all else being equal, I would choose the queues and jovially messy jiffy bag walls at teeny weeny St Mary's Street over the efficient brusqueness of Frederick Street.\n","before Take a cab! The worst shuttle service anywhere.  Left us sitting in the heat at the airport for 20 minutes.  Worse - we had prepaid the return.  Scheduled an 11 pickup - at 11:30 they still hadn't shown up.  Called and was told it was a shuttle service what did I expect.  Got a cab - and the complete insult - the cab fare + tip was LESS!\n","before Excellent selection of unusual meats. Very good taste and service. We go there on date nights and also take out of town company there.\n","before We had very good dealings with this dealership. Steve, our salesman was very knowledgeable and very laid back and not pushy at all. I would highly recommend this dealership\n","before Lins has decent food and a good selection. They never seem to run out of any of the items even when they are busy.\n","before The pizza is ok, but you don't come for that. You come for the experience. \n","However, small children and teens may not like it, especially on nights where there's lots of senior citizens since they'll flood the suggestion box with tunes from 40-60 years ago, and kids who were born in the last 20 years will quickly get bored, since they won't recognize any of the songs.\n","before Trash. Absolute trash.  I'd give it no stars if I could.\n","\n","It looks nice on the surface. The staff seems to be friendly, and will do everything they can to help you move in... But once they have you in contract, all bets are off. They treat you as less than dirt, and you will suddenly find dozens of Hidden Fees popping up after your first month's bill. \n","\n","If  you are reading this review and are thinking to yourself. \"Oh, this guy just has sour grapes,\" Well, think again. I was a model renter, I always paid my rent on time. and only complained when my apartment was full of roaches and the tub was leaking all over the floor after a few days of living there... Not that it did any good. They never fixed any of it.\n","\n","Vista valley has a vast majority of negative reviews on other sites like Apartment Ratings, A bad experience is the norm with this company. \n","Do yourself a favor and believe me when I say this complex is garbage.\n","before The food is just Meh, and I really don't have much to say about it, other than it's an expensive kind of Meh, but they recently removed all of the Pokémon GO stops from the area, as well as near other local businesses. It makes for a boring evening if you're a GO player, or have kids.\n","before They don't make you feel welcome, and it's always crowded. The servers act like you're bothering them most of the time. The food is ok, but not great. It's a very touristy place, but I also can't recommend it because the nearby resort recently removed all of the Pokémon Go stops in the area. This leaves kids with nothing to do, and shows a complete lack of respect to Go players. They don't want you there, so don't bother.\n","before Great food. Best orange chicken around. Crispy and sweet. The texture of the food is the best part of this place. It's not that nasty, soggy stuff you get at other asian restaurants.\n","before An update. They've been constantly bugging me, trying to threaten me with collections for the job which was never completed. Still the worst company in the world.\n","before Been coming here for years, and it's always just as good as the first time I came. A little hole-in-the-wallish, but that's part of it's charm. It's fine, no-frills delicious Mexican, with excellent chips and home-made hot sauce. Just about every item on the menu is a winner.\n","before You really can't beat the price, and it's better than your average budget pizza. I'd go here over Little Caesars.\n","before The service here is not great. You'll be dealing with kids right out of high school who have no idea what they're doing, but at the same time this must keep costs down, because you won't find what you're looking for any cheaper elsewhere. Usually 10-20% less than other big box retailers. \n","\n","Also, they really cater to Pokémon Go players here, and the stop in front of the store often has a lure on it.\n","before For a buffet, it's pretty good. Most asian places tend to have bland food with the texture of wet cardboard. This is a few steps above that. Only complaint is the price is a bit more than average.\n","before Tried this place for the first time today. Super cute little place! Very new and clean. The server was super friendly and efficient, really liked her!;) The prices were decent and everything was pretty spot on. Definitely will be my new Greek spot!;)\n","before Got there and had to wait for a table, which is fine. However; no one went to clean it and we spoke to 3 people for a table and they'd just go on with their business and we just stood there and were kinda neglected for awhile. (That's why they lost a star). But once we sat, it was all smooth sailing from there. Our waitress was great, told us we ordered A LOT of food, so we took an app off, which was really nice of her:) The owner came over and joked around with us which was really nice. Food was AMAZING! Love the subtle fusion of Korean in there. Overall, we really enjoyed it and will definitely be going back! I know salads are pretty boring, but I loved my Kale and quinoa salad with grilled chicken! Also, Seoul Poutine is a must try and their pizza looked divine! See you guys again soon!\n","before Been to this place a few times now, and it's overall pretty good. There's not many of these kids of brunchy places up here in Markham so I'm glad I found it!! Food tastes great, portions are HUUUGE and service is friendly. However, not the best idea to go in the summer because there's no air conditioning. It get EXTREMELY hot and unpleasant to eat:( Also, not the best idea to go if you are IN A RUSH!! Food kind of takes forever...even when it doesn't look busy in there. But overall, I like the place and would definitely go back!!:)\n","before We made an appointment for 3 people, but when we get there, there's only two girls working. So we obviously did not get our nails done at the same one. I got no massage or cream in hands OR feet..and when I told them when they were finished..not only did they not apologize, but they argued to say..\"We ALWAYS put cream.\" So now you're calling me an idiot for 'forgetting'? Fastest manicure predicure ever done in history, because girl took NO time to do my nails. She was on her cellphone HALF the time she was doing my nails. It's been 4 hours, and one nail has already chipped, with out any drastic bang or bump to the nail. Worst salon ever.\n","before I've been to this place at least a half a dozen times, almost every time I've been to vegas, I HAVE to go for brunch.  The price is reasonable since there is such a wide variety of different brunch items.  Here's what I would recommend:\n","\n","Salmon platter - so so fresh - will hit the spot if you want GOOD smoked salmon\n","\n","Chicken and Waffles - the most crispy yet tender waffle with a prefectly roasted chicken\n","\n","French Fries - weird to order this for breakfast but you just have to do it.  They are that perfect.  \n","\n","Bacon - who doesn't love crispy bacon?\n","\n","Berries - Perfect mix of strawberries, blueberries, raspberries, and blackberries with a vanilla bean cream.  I've ended every meal with this because it will cut the richness of whatever you order and make you feel like you had a dessert.  \n","\n","Can't wait to try the rest of the brunch menu!\n","\n","ENJOY!\n","before The below is just one person's experience and from the looks of the avg diner, it seems like it's a restaurant worth trying.  \n","\n","Vegas is a place of many many food options, from the casual to the super expensive.  Of course, Le Cirque, is considered high end of the spectrum.  We were not planning to dine there so we were all very very casually dressed, which resulted in us being put in the worst table of the house, by the bar at the front door.  The service was expected for the caliber of restaurant but the food was very much below expectations.  The first course lobster bisque was way way too salty.  The risotto was good but not memorable and the salad was a salad, just made to look pretty.  The short ribs were tender but not fall off the bone.  The halibut was not fresh but frozen, with a wrapping around it that was soggy and not what was intended in terms of texture context between the flesh and the breading.  The salmon was over cooked and dry, tasted like something a beginner cook would make.  The desserts were okay.  The waiter I remember was quite rude about the souffle.  The best part of a souffle is to break it yourself and pour in the cream\\/good stuff but the waiter did that for me without even asking.  The conversation with the waiter was douchy at best, felt like talking to cartoon character of what a waiter is supposed to be.  Back to the desserts. The lemon bomb's presentation was cool; it came in a bowl that was made out of ice, but the taste was too tart and didn't have a sweet balance to it.  The third dessert I think was chocolate but I don't remember.  Yes, people, unfortunately, this memories of this restaurant are all negative. The money would have been better spent else where I'm afraid.\n","before Hubert Keller, you did not disappoint.  I was very tempted to order the Rossini Burger but decided against it to design my own burger.  It was so yummy and juicy and flavorful.  There are different kinds of meat, bread, toppings, fries and onion rings, cheeses, and so many other options.  You can also add foie gras for an extra $12 dollars if you don't want to spend $60 for the Rossini.  I would definitely go back next time I'm in Vegas, even if it is so far from everything else.  \n","\n","Go and pig out!\n","before I am ONLY reviewing the two eating establishments here since we didn't stay here.  It was a time when we were both overly hungry and needed food ASAP.  The sandwich from the hotel was great the first bite and it got exponentially worse after every bite, since I was no longer starving.  Then we headed to that madeline's bakery that had just opened and ordered some eclairs.  Those eclairs looked good but the dough was gummy and soggy.  The cream tasted like Jello instant vanilla pudding and the chocolate outside tasted like Jello chocolate pudding.  All in all, everything looked pretty but didn't taste great.\n","before Food on the strip tends to be cheap and disgusting or super expensive and delicious.  Since we didn't want to spend an arm and a leg for every meal, we tried this place.  Just a mile down from the strip where all the asia restaurants seem to be, this place was humble in decor, which was a good sign.  However, it was not too packed on a Friday night, not a great sign.  I ordered the Wonton noodle soup and the broth was good but it didn't taste like it went through many hours of meat, bone, and marrow stewing.  The meat within the wonton tasted like it was previously frozen and it didn't have a great balance of meat and veg.  I ordered Thai Ice Tea with Boba and the Boba were super gummy, which meant they had been sitting in syrup for a while.  \n","\n","Overall, better than McDonalds but not the best Pho place.\n","before Comfortable fine dining is the perfect description for this place.  The space was warm, inviting, and simple.  The star was the food with its simple ease that makes good cooking seem like no work at all.  The cured meats plate was delicious with a variety of different kinds of pork, each different but complimentary to the warm bread puffs. The hand made pasta was a little too rich and buttery but that may be what others would love about it.  The pork chop was perfectly juicy and cooked precisely as asked. Unlike other high end places in Vegas, it wasn't intimidating or discouraging.  (see my review for le cirque if curious.)  Would definitely go back next time in Vegas.\n","before What do you do when it's 11:30pm and Raku is all booked?  Go to HK Star.  We called them 15mins before they were closing and they accommodated us.  We were the only ones there but we ordered quickly, the food (noodles of beef and chicken) came out fast and flavorful.  It's not gourmet or super authentic but if they were nice enough to let us eat when we were the ONLY ones in the dining room, it's not too bad.  Would definitely go back and try something else.\n","before 2.5 stars.  For those of you that have had the opportunity to have Buffs Wings in Newton, it was hard to think it was fantastic compared to Buffs.  The price was reasonable and we ordered two flavors, medium and Honey BBQ.  Medium was not as hot as I expected.  Honey BBQ was not bad.  It actually tasted sweeter if I had a buffalo first and then a honey bbq.  Not sure why but it worked.  The fries were good and crispy.  The sauce was too much and the wings themselves were not a little bit crispy.  It doesn't taste like it was ever fried.  The skin was kind of soggy and greasy.  \n","\n","The server was very nice though and she was just attentive enough.  \n","\n","If you're at the Outlet Mall, there is a ton of food options inside the mall.  I think I would have been more satisfied with maybe panda express' orange chicken.\n","before So much fun!\n","\n","Had a chance to see the Human Nature (presented by Smokey Robinson) at the Venetian in Las Vegas a couple of years ago.  It was a nice treat that evening from our friends that lived locally in Vegas. The show featured Motown hits performed by four outstanding vocalists from Australia's top-selling pop vocal group (brothers, Andrew and Mike, and Toby and Phil... all schoolmates from Sydney).  The venue was at the Sands Showroom which was nice because it wasn't too big, in fact, there was not a bad seat in the house. Our seats were not that close to the stage but still good... let's just say we could see the perspiration from their foreheads as they performed their hits! It was Motown classic songs with a modern twist and new sound.\n","\n","Great show from the beginning to end with some beautiful acapella singing and harmonizing at its best down to the synchronized dance moves that gets you clapping along and swaying to the music. There is audience participation during the show and you could be chosen to be called up on the stage to sing with them and be featured in their Facebook page... I wondered why my friend had me sit at the end of the row closest to the aisle... now I know and glad I wasn't chosen to go on stage. [what? Me shy??... Yes!]. Anyway, it was an evening of great entertainment!\n","\n","Review #0339\n","before Great food!\n","\n","This restaurant isn't located on the Strip... this place isn't Hash House A Go Go, Momofuku, Wicked Spoon nor is it Eggslut (although I've bookmarked those places for future visits) but because of that it doesn't have the food prices you pay when dining at the Strip. Get it? For a little over $20 we were able to fill our tummies with delicious food.\n","\n","I had Ely's Burger. Beef, cheese, grilled onions, mushrooms, lettuce, tomato and mayo... hold the pickles and red onion, please. The meal came with crinkle-cut fries. I love the mushrooms in this burger. Tasty and delicious!  Hubby had the Bacon (or Sausage) Skillet. He scarfed it down... no need to ask him if he enjoyed his meal. \n","\n","This place has a casual dining atmosphere, nothing fancy. They serve classic American food, breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Great, affordable prices. Our table was well taken care of. Very attentive servers but not overly. They were friendly and nice. Hubby loves wearing his GS Warriors shirts and it always gets attention from sports fans when we go places. Had engaged in a convo with the server who also processed our bill (Lakers fan). Then, I'm not sure if it was the owner that said to me as we were leaving... \"review us in Yelp\" (now how did he know I Yelp??). Worth coming back to when we're in town again :)\n","\n","Review #0835\n","before Rude!\n","\n","Happened to find a receipt from the nightmare we experienced with this towing company and I had not had a chance to write a review about it.\n","\n","This actually happened about 2-1\\/2 years ago during one of our weekend getaways in Las Vegas. We parked at the lot that was adjacent to (at the time) The Riviera on Las Vegas Boulevard South. There were two other cars there so we thought it was safe. It was around 9:00p at night. Wanted to see if the Groupon we purchased for the show Illusions, featuring German Illusionist Jan Rouven, could be redeemed even though the deal was purchased while the show was still at the Clarion on Convention Center. Las Vegas Strip changes so much, both casinos have gone bankrupt since and are no longer there. Illusions is now showing at the Tropicana. Sorry, I digress....\n","\n","We parked and ran inside The Riviera to inquire if we are still able to exchange the deal for tickets to the show but unfortunately we were not able to. We were only gone for 10 minutes since parking the car and we came back to a tow truck from this company with our car already hooked to his truck! That was the scariest thing I saw and experienced. Hubby and I pleaded with the tow operator to give us a break and we told him that we did not see any signs and that there were other cars parked on the lot too. It was dark and he pointed to an itty-bitty sign stating that the lot was a private lot. I practically begged the guy to not tow our car since we were already there to claim the car but he insisted on bringing it to their impound lot, plus we don't have $360+ in cash that he was asking to claim the car. He finally agreed to unhook the car after 15 minutes of trying to reason with him. He was asking for $153 cash. Had to run back inside Riviera Casino to get cash from an ATM machine. I was just glad that he agreed to give us back our car right there but the guy was still a jerk, rude and a scam. \n","\n","Now we get paranoid in parking in public areas like that... I think these people are just waiting for victims to prey on. We were only gone for 10 minutes (maybe even less), how could he have showed up there so fast.\n","\n","Review #0381\n","before a delight!\n","\n","Have never had authentic Cuban food before... but then again this is my first time eating Cuban food. Came here for lunch. The host was very friendly and we were seated right away. Did not quite know what to order because I had a little difficulty understanding the menu and the waitress wasn't really helpful (language barrier). Finally ordered the Churrasco con Chimi-Churri and it didn't disappoint... I love meat and this meal was delicious. The meal included rice and some type of sauce that you spread over the rice... the value was excellent (although we used a Groupon deal). It had a large bar and also a room with a dance floor, must be fun during the evenings. I would try this place again.\n","\n","The second time I visited this place to have lunch with my hubby the place has been renovated and they have added a bakery! Sweet!\n","\n","Review #0148\n","before Never again!\n","\n","Stayed in this establishment for the weekend. The crowd in this casino is more for the younger generation.  A bit too rowdy for me. If not for its great location in the middle of the strip we would not have stayed here but what can you expect for the cheap prices. Also, aside from all the negative reviews this hotel received I'd like to add that the parking lot stinks and is confusing. Need more \"Exit\" signs... the ground floor area gets flooded really bad when there is heavy rains (this was in July this year) and we were almost late for Frank Merino's \"Divas\" because they closed off the back parking entrance due to flooded area.\n","\n","Review #0014\n","before Welcome to Fabulous Las Vegas!\n","\n","Las Vegas has many nicknames, including Entertainment Capital of the World, The Marriage Capital of the World, Gambling Capital of the World, That Mirage in the Desert, Hot Vegas... and the most famous one which is Sin City -- strip clubs, cabarets, clubbing, 24-hour liquor sales, gambling, easy marriage, easy divorce.

Maybe it's the bright lights on the Las Vegas Strip, the 24\\/7 open casinos, the beautiful (and mediocre) hotels, the plethora of restaurants and food places, the alcohol, the shows, the entertainment... ahh! all crammed in one weekend adventure.\n","\n","It's one of our favorite places to getaway, after all, hubby and I got married in Las Vegas almost 7 years ago. We've made road trips here as well as flew in. We've stayed at the Bellagio, Luxor, Stratosphere and back then Imperial Palace (which is now replaced by The Linq). Most of the time though we stay at our timeshare resort further down S Las Vegas Blvd. We've enjoyed shows and entertainment acts but have yet to see a performance by a known singer. Dining, now that alone can take you over the top of your budget (if you have one), there are so many good food places to eat! We try to dine outside of the Strip but more than once we'd like to try the more popular spots in town.\n","\n","When we have more vacay time we will spend one evening on the Strip but the rest of the time we will branch off and drive to other states. Las Vegas will be our home base but we will drive to Utah and Arizona to visit National Parks and other places of interest. \n","\n","And, poof! just like that, your weekend is done and time to head home... now stop daydreaming and just plan your next getaway to Vegas! Remember, what happens in Vegas no longer stays in Vegas... What happens in Vegas stays in Facebook, IG and Snapchat! :)\n","\n","Drive Carefully, Come Back Soon!\n","\n","Review #0845\n","before Delicious Ramen!\n","\n","Randomly found this place while searching for places to dine outside of Las Vegas. Dining on the Strip tend to be costly since 85% of the people that go there are tourists, 10% of the people probably work there and maybe some 5% are locals that party there. That is my non-scientific prediction. LoL!\n","\n","Still in Las Vegas it is about 11 miles from where we were staying at the Hard Rock Cafe on Paradise Rd. No crowds, although, I heard this place does get crowded. Had lunch here on a Saturday afternoon. I ordered the Miso Ramen (bean sprouts for crunch, scallions for flavor, soy-cured egg half with a bouncy firmness, seaweed, wood fungus [kikurage], fish cake, chashu and ground pork topped with a square of nori on the side). So good and yummy!  Hubby enjoyed his Beef Ramen, who likes it hot and spicy, while our teen ordered her favorite shrimp tempura. \n","\n","The inside is spacious and the tables were spaced out nicely (compared to our local Ramen House Ryujin in Sacramento). The interior decor is nice and modern with Asian flair. Very clean. The service was fast. We got our food in fairly good time. The servers were friendly and attentive to our table. It was a nice treat to be able to dine here. We will certainly come back again on our next Vegas visit! The restaurant is located on the corner of a shopping plaza with plenty of parking.\n","\n","Review #0905\n","before Love WorldMark!\n","\n","I usually love our stay here at WorldMark on S Las Vegas Blvd and often stay at this location when in town but the studio we were assigned to was not completely prepared.  Although the place was clean it was missing the usual 'welcome' setting I was used to.  On the dining table for two it was missing the placemats and centerpiece.  Later on in the day we found the placemats on top of the fridge.  Also, there was no centerpiece on the living room table as well where they usually have the little WorldMark 'welcome' sign... other than those things the place was well equipped.  I still give it high marks because this was just an isolated incident. Sorry, as a WorldMark owner these are just little things but when you're used to some things WorldMark provides you expect it each time you stay in one of their resorts. Love the security WorldMark provides especially coming in the resort. The pool and Lazy River is wonderful too!\n","\n","Review #0146\n","before Not bad\n","\n","This restaurant was located inside Terrible's Casino but I think is now called Silver Sevens Hotel \u0026 Casino. Our visit was in late May this year and we strolled in pretty late looking for the buffet but was closed so we happen to drop in this place instead called Bougainvillea Café (now called The Sterling Spoon Café). We were seated right away and given a menu. Wasn't much on the menu but we were able to order from their 'Dine After Dark Graveyard Specials' This menu is served daily from midnight to 6:00a. Menu included Biscuits \u0026 gravy, French toast, New York steak \u0026 eggs and others I can't remember. I had the pork chops with two eggs cooked over easy and hashbrown (see my photo). It was unexpectedly delicious and tasty and the meal was very cheap! I think it was around $4.99. Our full bill came out to $10.79 or something like that. It wasn't the best restaurant  in town but it was okay for the price. Staff was friendly and always made sure our glasses of waters were always full.\n","\n","Review #0167\n","before Lunch at the Don's...\n","\n","Well, that's what it felt like as hubby and I had lunch at this speakeasy. The restaurant opened for lunch at 11:00a but we got there a little early and couldn't really tell where the entrance was. We parked and looked like the place was boarded up... turns out the front entrance was not so obvious. In fact, we entered in this wooden door to find another closed door that was a waiting room (no seats). We had to ring the doorbell and wait until someone opened a little peep window to let us in. This little waiting place had photos of wanted mafia members and dons. We were let inside the restaurant by a host who looked like he portrayed an associate dressed as a gangster, suspenders and all, and led us past the bar to the back section of the restaurant. \n","\n","The quiet, casual elegant setting had a mob theme with the red leather seats, the glass chandeliers, the black wallpapered walls, and more photos of mafia dons and gangsters hung on the walls. It was like a scene from The Godfather, the movie. It is dark inside. The wait staff catered to our needs as we were served green salad w\\/ garlic dressing, bread\\/butter and our orders. I had the \"Capones Carbonara\" (pancetta, tomatoes, peas, red onions, shallots \u0026 fettuccini tossed in garlic egg cream sauce). Eccelente! Mangia!!! Hubby had the  \"Vinnie's Chicken Parmesan Melt\" (chicken breast, breaded, fried, topped with mozzarella cheese and their secret sauce). If reading that description didn't make your mouth water, well, there are lots more from their menu to choose from and cleverly named with mafia themes. Our food and the atmosphere was great!\n","\n","The restaurant looked like it can accommodate large groups and banquets as well as intimate dinners for two . There is a private room and it had a booth that can seat two, it also had a screen like you can watch a movie or something. This room had a door and it is in between the bar and the restroom away from the rest of the dining area. \n","\n","Located less than 15 minutes from the Strip this made our dining experience unforgettable! Thought that we would get a visit from the don himself... after all, Las Vegas had a history of mafia crime lords.\n","\n","Review #0459\n","before One for the adventure books!\n","\n","So here we go... never in my life would I have thought that I'd be riding in one of these quads as a driver and not as a passenger in an ATV tour. Blame it on my hubby who loves the outdoor adventures and we found this deal in Groupon to add to our list of 'things to do' during a mini getaway in Vegas.\n","\n","The adventure begins... we called the business to book a tour and the process was quite easy on the phone. We even had a reminder phone call on the evening prior to our scheduled date. We gathered at the Excalibur Hotel grounds where we were picked up by a complementary shuttle. The drive to the actual tour site was about an hour from the Las Vegas strip. \n","\n","When we got there we were briefed on safety and our itinerary, which included 28-miles of scenery. The tour was for approximately three hours and were divided in two groups - beginners (that's me and my hubby) and the more experienced guests. It was my first time EVER to grip throttles as we dashed through the beautiful red-rock scenery, nature trails and desert landscapes of the Valley of Fire State Park on our ATV's. The ride included unlimited water bottles and a deli lunch sandwich. For 3 hours we kicked up dusts, outpacing little creatures on our mini ATV's, careened over dusty hills while decked out in our riding gears (there was a 30-min break for lunch). What an adventure! Our three professional guides were very nice (and patient) to lead us beginners over the hills and skid through the ravines of the Valley Of Fire State Park. One led in front of the group while the other stayed in the very back, making sure no one was left behind, and one drove along in a jeep (just in case one of us, for any reason, had to ride back to base). TIP: (for women with long hair)... tie your hair or roll into a bun and tuck it in inside your helmet.\n","\n","jR and I had a blast and at the end said he was proud of me for going along with him in this tour! I'm just glad I survived it as we were shuttled back to Excalibur Hotel. LoL! well... you only live once!  5-stars for professionalism and a fun vacation experience!\n","\n","Review #0343\n","before Dancing Queen!\n","\n","Great show that would make you want to get on your feet and dance with ABbA's catchy tunes from the late 70's.  Although I have not seen their performance in Las Vegas (are they still in Las Vegas?) I have seen this musical 3x elsewhere. Once at the Orpheum in San Francisco in 2001 and twice at the California Musical Theatre in 2005 and 2012! Great show and funny story.\n","\n","The show is nothing about the band at all. I am familiar with the songs from ABba and I thought it was clever to produce a musical based on the songs and tell an original story. It is a feel-good musical featuring more than 20 classic ABBA hits you may or may not be familiar with, including \"Dancing Queen\", \"S.O.S.\" \"Mamma Mia\", \"Take a Chance on Me\", Chiquitita\", \"The Name of the Game\", \"Winner Take It All\", \"Money, Money, Money\" and \"Does Your Mother Know\".  The cast was great... I will always be biased and favor the cast ensemble from the first time I watched it. The costumes were great and the show takes you to flashback 70's.  Fantastic and fun finale!\n","\n","Review #0338\n","before Taste of Las Vegas!\n","\n","We visited on Thanksgiving Day and they were open!  A chocolate shoppe complete with free sample, tasting experience, tours, and a botanical cactus garden with 300+ species of cacti. They have a huge self guided viewing aisle window where we could watch chocolatiers make these yummy treats. I understand that around the holiday season the factory hours varies so from time to time, the factory may not be bustling with chocolatiers during visits so I guess we got lucky we were able to see a few. At the time of our visit one of the chocolatiers was making candy caramel apples. A few feet behind was a long table with the biggest pecan brittle! The self-guided tours are free but the tasting experience is not and is $14.99 per person but there is a $5 Discount if you check in Yelp . All this is open to the public. \n","\n","I enjoyed taking a leisurely stroll through the cactus garden and view the botanical desert terrain. The garden was adorned with holiday lights and I can only imagine how pretty it was lit at night. From the parking lot it didn't look very big but the garden was featured four acres of drought-tolerant ornamental, cacti, and other succulents. Cool! \n","\n","The staff was friendly and helpful. Parking is plentiful! Purchased a few signature peanut clusters in milk and dark chocolate (almond nut clusters and Almond Butter Krisps). Each piece was $1.99, yikes! They were so good and yummy! I do love my chocolates! They are also affiliated with Mars which is M\u0026M's which makes M\u0026M's peanuts (my favorite). We also found some Ethel M products at the M\u0026M's World last night.\n","\n","UPDATE:\n","We came back two nights later for the Cactus Garden. The Botanical Garden is so pretty at night with all the lights on display. The once empty huge parking lot in the daytime was full and was packed with guests. A must see during the holiday season! So glad I was able to witness this during our visit. \n","\n","Review #0903\n","before Great Place, Yummy desserts!\n","\n","This was my first visit here at The Patio. They've only been open for business for 4 months and this place was packed! I don't think they take reservations but one from our party, who called ahead of time, was told that hopefully the crowd would slow down around our meeting slot of 9:30p... one would think, right? Nope! this place closed at 1:00a and guests kept coming.\n","\n","Looked through the delicious list of dessert and drink items from their menu. Wanted to try everything as they all looked yummy! But I decided on having the Honey Toast which came with fresh fruits and one scoop of homemade ice cream. It was a block of toasted bread with the insides carved out and cut in small bite size cubes and topped with the scoop of ice-cream (I chose creamy espresso flavor). A small bottle of honey was in a separate container poured separately along with the fresh fruits placed on the side... eaten all together and the result was so yummy! it caught my taste buds off guard! \n","\n","The setting was nice and cozy with a small swing set in the waiting area of their lobby which was a nice touch but clearly they need to add more table seating in their dining area. There is no patio despite the business name. Had our group of 9-1\\/2 (nine adults and one child) gotten any bigger we wouldn't have been able to sit together. Actually, we were kindly offered another small table next to our long table but our seating was on the high table that seated eight and the small table would've made two from our party left out... at the end it all worked out and we all had a great time. Great service, atmosphere and delicious desserts.\n","\n","Review #0831\n","before mmm! halo halo :)\n","\n","Came to this area on the Eastside one evening at Maryland Pkwy looking for a boba place. When I saw Jollibee I knew I wanted halo-halo instead! what? can't a girl change her mind? LoL! For those unfamiliar with the Jollibee restaurants they are a Philippines-based chain known for its burgers, fried chicken, spaghetti \u0026 Filipino dishes. But we didn't have any of that I mentioned, instead, we had halo-halo and it was delicious! Not all halo-halo are made equally... some do not taste as good.\n","\n","The fast food restaurant is right next to the Seafood City grocery market with the 'bee' greeting you at that entrance but it also has its own entrance from outside. Just like any fast food place you walk up to the counter and place your order and your receipt # will be called when food is ready. The staff was friendly and someone kept the dining area clean at all times.\n","\n","We came on Thanksgiving evening... it was around 9:00p and the place was packed, young and old! wth... no one cooked turkey that day and decided to eat at Jollibee? Anyway, a couple of seats down from us there was this cute little girl, I'd say she was around 5 years old and, well, you know, Filipinos love to sing...  she was singing the chorus line of \n","Havana, ooh na-na (ay)\n","Half of my heart is in Havana, ooh-na-na (ay, ay)\n","\n","... then my mind kept singing that song all night after we left :)\n","\n","Review #0913\n","before I know it's rare but...\n","\n","After being let down by our original reservation with another big name car rental company who changed the location of our car pick up last minute (the day before our travel) my hubby had to scramble and book another car from another rental place.. FOX came through.\n","\n","We took the shuttle from the Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport to the car rental location. As we were making our way towards where the Fox counter was we were already dreading the long line that was formed in a snake line. When we got there, Yay! the long line was for Payless! There were 3 companies that shared the counter. I forgot what the other company was but Fox only had 1 customer ahead of us and there were two attendants behind the counter so we were immediately assisted by the second attendant. This was around 10:00p on a busy Friday night.\n","\n","Anyway, we were able to get our reserved car. No hassles, no pressure on up sells, no hidden charges and service was friendly. They do require a $150 deposit refunded upon return of the car. 3 days with unlimited miles $81.29. Pick up and return from the car lot was easy as well. The car ran well and was a gas saver (first time driving a Toyota Prius). This isn't our first time renting with Fox but it is here in Phoenix location and we had a good experience with Fox this time.\n","\n","Review #0606\n","before Parking fees in casinos on the Strip\n","\n","Love coming to Vegas. We used to frequent visiting Sin City, sometimes three times a year, but lately have slowed down and this year, 2017, was our first time back in Vegas since Feb 2016! wow! has it been that long... no wonder I was longing for it in this last mini getaway! Anyway, found out that many of the casinos have done away with the free parking! The good old days of plentiful free parking at casinos ended in 2016. Bummer! Wait, I take that back... I think some casinos offer 0-60 mins free parking. It's true that parking garages here are so abundant but unless you're staying at or patronizing the resort you have to fork out $ for parking fees. Now it's all about parking in one spot, pay the fees, and walk, walk, walk... I suppose one can take the monorails too. \n","\n","While I'm done ranting about the newly imposed parking fees (new to me, at least) I do enjoy walking around the Strip. I'm not talking about from one end to another. I enjoyed it best during Pacquiao's fights held at the MGM (held usually in May). Hubby and I come to Vegas to celebrate our birthdays around that time. Loved the hype it brought. I also enjoyed the outdoor shows... Treasure Island, The Mirage and Bellagio. \n","\n","And damn those Las Vegas card flickers. If you've ever been to Vegas, you know what I'm talking about. Although, I didn't see any this time while walking around Treasure Island and crossing over to Wynn. Are they gone now?\n","\n","If flying in Vegas one can see the Strip with all the lights as your plane is about to land. I always look for either the Stratosphere (The tallest observation tower in the U.S.) or the light beam from the Luxor on the southern end (the Luxor Sky Beam is the strongest beam of light in the world). I look for these landmarks when our plane is about to descend at McCarran Int'l Airport. Lots of car traffic as well as foot traffic on the Strip. Lots of lights. Lots of tourists. Lots of shops, restaurants, bars and lounges. This place comes alive on weekends.  What happens in Vegas stays in... Facebook, IG, and Snapchat (nowadays). Be mindful :)\n","\n","Review #0838\n","before Puke in the pool, place was DEAD as a private party was starting in a few hours and they still wanted to charge for lounge chairs even though they were closing early at 3pm. What a joke, I'll go to the regular pool and have a better time thank you very much\n","before Ehhhhh, It was a lot of hype. Place was packed, 45 minute wait for a table of 2. We walked over to the bar instead and had a couple of beers. Good thing we didnt invest much more as the beers were just ok, nothing special in my opinion. We tried a few other samples just to make sure and we were sure :(\n","\n","Kinda disappointed but oh well, cant win em all.\n","before 2.5 stars\n","\n","Kinda lame experience, food was a little bland and underwhelming, service was mediocre at best. Ordered the Flanny's Favorite Burger with egg, bacon, etc and it was lacking in flavor. Everything was fresh but severely under-seasoned. They should train the cooks to season the meat before they put it on the grill (and the egg too!). \n","\n","I felt the beer list was a little lacking as well. Lots of choices but many were similar. Only 1 IPA and 1 Pale on the entire draft list seems a bit low in my book. I know it changes frequently so maybe I just caught it at an off time, also 2 beers were out. Would have liked to see more choices of these. Also a more extensive bottle\\/can list would have been appreciated. I did enjoy the mac and cheese though, it was yummy. Service was just ok, our girl was friendly but at times absent. I dont think I would return\n","before All in all a good hotel. Id rather stay at another and just come here to hit the pools, shops, and casino. The pool is the highlight for sure\n","before We stopped in on our walk from Cosmo to NY NY for the Cirque show. awesome draft list for Vegas, the food didnt blow me away but it wasnt bad either and since I was there for the beer anyway its just an added bonus. I will def be hittin this place up next time Im back\n","before Sundays, get there before 12\n","before Short rib and beef cheek sandwich pretty delicious. Not $24 delicious but def still tasty\n","\n","I would say all in all a good experience with a nice hefty Vegas price tag to go with some scrumptious pub food\n","before I could write details but lets just say. Vegas is gonna get in your pocket somehow be it a gordon rasmey joint or bobbly flay spot even some other fancy steakhouse. Save it go here. best $$$$ dinning experience I have had on my many restaurant experiences here. The filet was banging, the scallop appertizer was fire, so fresh, the lobster bisque was light, creamy and delightful. The halibut entree was cooked perfect although the kumqut sauce was a bit much. Service was on point. I also had the kobe tartare and loved it. It was one of the best tartares Ive had in a while. All the food was cooked perfectly and to top it all off the had a Dogfish 60 min IPA for $7 which I found really odd as a Sierra Nevada was $11. The definitely know their beef and its priced fairily as for the beer they have not a clue. \n","\n","I'll eat here again\n","before As far as Vegas Club experiences go this one is a the top of my list. \n","\n","I dont go to clubs to wait in long lines and get crammed on to dance floors.\n","\n","I go for the table service and the vip experience which I feel is the right way to see these places so that is the point of view I am sharing.\n","\n","We had a \"Skybox\" over looking the dance floor its was roomy enough for the 10 of us. We originally had 12 but 2 dudes dropped out, if it had been all 12 it might have been a little tight up there.\n","\n","From start to finish the service was spot on. The security was security, not like others described in their reviews. They didnt mingle with our girls or flirt, they monitored our area escorted others away from our area, escorted us to the bathrooms (HUGE BONUS!!!). The servers\\/hosts were very friendly, outgoing, gracious and hospitiable. The never once let our drinks go empty. The server assistant kept our are super clean the whole night. He was constantly walking by picking up our glasses wiping up ice spills, etc.\n","\n","The dancers are hot, the tub girls I found to be lovely, and the music was good. From start to finish TAO was great, I'll go back in a heartbeat and do it all over again.\n","\n","Cheers TAO and thanks for an awesome VIP experience it was truly appreciated\n","before 4.5 Stars overall\n","\n","Very friendly service and patrons. Came in on a Saturday afternoon for a quick beer and a pint glass. I had been looking for something unique in the area and didn't love the beers at SanTan and wasn't able to go to Four Peaks on 8th as the line was insane on a Saturday afternoon. \n","\n","Overall I thought the beers were pretty good for my bastardized Cali IPA based frame if reference. I enjoyed the Magic in the Ivy. I also tried a few of their other beers, Fresh Magic, which wasn't so fresh anymore as it is a Wet Hop beer that was about 4 months old and I had their IPA. The That'll Do IPA was a 3\\/5 but not that amazing when compared to what I'm used to. \n","\n","I loved the fact that the taproom was set up to be very social and also they had other beers featured as well. I liked that I could come in and taste the Huss brews and then also some other unaffiliated beers as well. I had the Super IPA collaboration from New Belgium and Alpine as well. \n","\n","I thoroughly enjoyed my time at Huss and thought the level of service was fantastic. the prices are also insanely reasonable to fill your growler and if I lived local would have bought one without hesitation. I'll definitely go back my next time in Tempe\n","before Great place to watch the games, grab some super delicious craft beers and enjoy one of their amazing specials. We split a burger and the fish and chips. Both were real good and very fairly priced in my opinion. We had 4 beers and 2 entrees and were out the door for about $40. This same meal at my local spot in Cali would cost me at least 50% more.\n","before They no longer have happy hour. Boo...........\n","before I would describe this is A-OK, nothing blew my mind but nothing was bad either. The only thing I would give 5 stars to was the venue itself. Sweet separated bar area from the dining area and an amazing outside patio\\/courtyard.\n","\n","I went on a Saturday night with my family and we had a lot of dishes. I really wished the queso was hotter (temperature wise) and a much larger portion. My combo plate was good but not amazing as I had hoped for. Again nothing was bad I was just hoping for more. The different tortillas we tried we all delicious. Id go back here again just to drink in the courtyard and snack. Im not sold on the full dinner experience as it was just so-so. The service was stellar though\n","before 2.5 stars\n","\n","I wish the burger was better, granted I went at like 2am but still I was expecting more for my first FATBURGER experience. The bun seemed a bit dry and the burger was sliding around the bun a lot, huge turnoff. The fries were alright I was just hoping it was gonna be like an in and out with some beer to go with but not the case. I'd try it again in hopes it would be more like how it is in my dreams. Til next time Fatburger\n","before I loved it here. I had he miso ramen and it was so damn good. I can't wait until I'm back in Charlotte again and can give this place another go. The food was so fresh! I sat at the bar and just watched dishes pass me by that I wish I could have devoured.\n","\n","Great service too, super friendly and very knowledgeable about the product.\n","before Solid off the strip spot in Vegas, def worth hittin up to get away from the madness. Tapas style restaurant lots of good bites.  4 of us went on a Monday and had no problem getting a table for 7:30.

Super clean, A\\/C broken callled service line, fixed in 20 minutes! Amazing service here. Room was sweet, great view of strip, nice extra 1\\/2 bath for our guests, full kitchen.

Came here on Sunday with mine and my brothers family. They are GF, we are not and there are 3 kids between the ages of 2-9. Everyone had a great time and there was plenty for all of us. Great selection of beers, cider for them, and a very extensive menu of pub offerings. \n","\n","The kids loved it! Tons of games..... From board games, to life sized connect 4, and ping pong to beach volleyball this place has it all. It a wonderful place for families and a place I would go to solo and sit at the bar.\n","\n","We had a blast and would certainly return!\n","before Ehhhh,\n","\n","Service spotty, food didnt come out as ordered. Some food came out ten minutes before others and we only had a party of 4. \n","\n","Odd experience overall and then we the food finally arrived it wasnt even that good. Maybe a bad experience maybe not but next time I'll probably pass on Holstiens.\n","before Yes yes and yes, open late, pizza was piping hot and super delicious @ 3:30am, possibly the best place to eat in the Cosmo\n","before Should be called house of deliciousness!\n","\n","I could go on and on about this item, that item, blah blah blah but I dont really waznt to. This is good food, done creatively, and in my mind presented in a casual yet sophisticated manner without any pretensiousness. The chef here creates inspirational dishes that seem to meld asian and southwestern flavors seemlessly. Ok so now I realize this are not all real words but after eating here and developing a drunken state of mind who really cares anyhow?\n","\n","The lowdown is the food is good and priced fair for what you get. Our service was great and on top of everything we truly had an amazing time on a rainy Saturday evening. Next time hopefully we can enjoy the killer outdoor bar and patio seating.\n","I cant wait to go back and eat our way through the new menu.\n","\n","The custom cocktails were delightful and the wine list is pretty spot on.\n","before Dropped in for a quick snack around 12 noon on a Saturday. Awesome location on Mill and super cool views from the upstairs and balconies. If it was warmer we would have sat outside. \n","\n","Good service, good beers, and Southwest Spring Rolls. That's a 4 star experience anyday\n","before Hip spot all around. Chandelier Bar is mad cool, Bond Bar is my favorite, I usually do well here at the tables, the rooms are dope and w\\/balconies which is a huge bonus. Secret pizza is the flipping best and the buffet is aight. One of my favorite hotels on the stip. Service at boulevard pool is also pretty amazing, great pool!\n","before I had a bartender follow me out on Friday night and accuse me of not tipping and continued to question why I didn't. Which I did! I had tipped her 20%. I honestly do not wish to go back because of the way she had treated us. Thanks again!\n","before The pear salad is awesome! Pizza is\n","Always great! Wish they had a bigger wine selection but always good eats!\n","before Went at 9:30pm and the place was closed.

All local draft beer, which was very good. Sat at the bar so I can't comment on the table service, but the bar servers were on the ball. Would definitely go back.\n","before Disappointing all around. Beer was ho-hum. Tried multiple IPAs, which I normally prefer, and they were all mediocre at best. Ordered the $14 fish and chips and three nuggets and fries came out. The breading was burned and the inside was raw so I sent it back. Switched to the burger, which was as expensive and mediocre as well. Tasted like a frozen patty. Would never recommend this place. Only saving grace was that the bartender was nice.\n","before Really great little place.  I had the Breakfast sausage, and I rank it as the best thing I've eaten in Cleveland.  The Rabbit Poutine was really good as well. The Poutine serving sizes could be cut back by a third to be more suitable for one person though, my girlfriend and I had a hard time finishing one order between the two of us.  Overall great place, we will return!\n","before Top notch bakery by any standard. My only complaint is the fact the handful of times they were closed for vacation when I was in the area and decided to stop in.  All the croissants are amazing!\n","before Everything I've ever gotten here has been delicious, including the old breakfast standards.  Great staff, friendly and personable.\n","before I was very disappointed. My husband and I went for dinner yesterday evening. He ordered the filet and I ordered the New York strip. Both were cook perfectly medium rare. But we're lacking so much flavor!! I appreciate the five steak sauces the presented to us (because I would need someone to mask the bland taste) But I'm a firm believer, that when a steak is seasoned and cooked properly there is no need for steak sauce. Besides being utterly disappointed with our steak. We ordered the creamed spinach and mushrooms. Both were very good. Service was great always on top of things.\n","before Total let down! Went a few weeks ago after waiting for about 30min (which wasn't a surprise seeing how busy they were) we were excited because we have heard so many great things. I felt like we were being rushed (I get it you need to turn tables over) after ordering. We received our food. I feel to even call it mediocre would be a compliment. And then I was charged for a drink I didn't order and it was only two of us. Service wasn't great either everyone looked depressed I won't be back to give this place a second chance after the bad taste it left in my mouth.\n","before The original place use to be fiesta and chips and we loved it, it has since been taken over by new owners. The two stars are for the servers. Omar was my server and he was very attentive and nice, and there was another young man that was helpful as well. The thing that kinda bothered me was when we came in it was slow so all the servers were just standing around and it made me uncomfortable because I felt like they kept staring. The menu is much more expensive. My son loved the nachos from the previous owners so we decided to give theirs a shot, and I got two fish tacos. The tacos were about the same price but half the portion size, and I was super disappointed with the fish. It was tilapia but had a super fishy taste. I ended up taking it out and putting the meat from my sons nachos and putting it in my tacos. Wasn't super wowed.\n","before I absolutely love this location!! It's always clean, and everyone who works there is so sweet and helpful. The only downside is there is never any parking. But I can deal with due to all the positives!!\n","before Nice place to take the kids price isn't too bad. Worth getting an annual pass for $40 adult and $25 for children\n","before Wish I took pictures of how amazing the food looked!! Such a nice selection!! An you can't find sushi and Korean BBQ anywhere else!! The staff was so friendly and attentive. Cannot wait to come back and bring more friends!\n","before Awful costumer service!!! I felt like I was being rushed even though there weren't any people behind me. I'm assuming the woman who \"assisted\" me was a manger because she was the only one I saw in a red shirt. But she needs a course on costumer service. She was very short and acted as if I was wasting her time. I don't care how badly we want bagels we will never return to this location.\n","before This update is way over due!! Last month I had my nails done by Brenda and she was so awesome and the only reason I'm giving 5 stars. Still disappointed that this spa doesn't offer a better color selection for the prices and still no glitter or fun things to add to nails. But Brenda was so sweet and very easy to converse with!\n","before I was supposed to get waxed last week for the first time but apparently my underarm hair wasn't long enough, so I was told to come back and make an appointment for the following week. So my following appointment was made for Tuesday the 18th and upon entering the establishment both times all of the women I encountered were so welcoming and made me feel comfortable!! Kai was my esthetician, and as uncomfortable as I was having some one not only stare at my hairy underarms but have to touch them; she made me feel at ease by making small talk. I will definitely be returning for a follow up and I'm considering a Brazilian for the future. This place is super professional and clean!! I would recommend it in a heart beat!\n","before Nice little spot close to home and they have great lunch specials. We always get food Togo, we will have to try dining in one day. But the food is always great!!\n","before We love this place we got married here, and have most of out family celebrations here. The rooms are lovely, we really like the two bed suite. It's gorgeous!! The balcony wraps around the entire suite!\n","before Love his place wish it was bigger. But I think it's like the subway of sushi. Super cool take. I have worked in a sushi restaurant and I felt like their fish was fresh. Totally worth the price. Wish their was one closer to home\n","before So happy we came into this place!! We live right around the corner and have never been before... Boy what a mistake!! This will be our new spot for sure!! Service was great. Rocia was so sweet!!! Good was amazing everything we order was perfect!! Can't wait to come back!\n","before Went for brunch today. Super disappointed in the salad bar. I guess I had high expectations going in because I was expecting something similar to Texas de Brazil. It was much smaller and nothing tastes great. The best part was the bottomless mimosas and bloody Mary's. The meat was okay nothing to fav over my favorite would have to be the garlic steak. Had a few issues checking out. But other than that it was okay. Don't think we will be back but that's only because I know we can get a better selection of food at the same price else where.\n","before Just wanna update and say we love our sever Aaron he's the best!! Always on top of everything give this man a raise!! And out favorite sushi chefs Kevin \u0026 Nick!!! The three of them alone make this place awesome..lol and the sushi is good too\n","before Went here when if was embers and loved the food and service but couldn't get over how dead it was. I think it's just forgotten about. But we we're excited to find a place that has tacos and happy hour. I would totally come back for just beer, chips and salsa. The food was nothing special and service lacked. Not sure if our waitress was training or not cause we saw someone shadow her a few times but if that the case I blame her trainer. It was too slow to receive the service we received. Love the area and so close to home but doubt we will be back. I hope they are able to turn things around.\n","before Love, love, love this place!!!! Staff is awesome and so attentive, management is awesome as well. Becky was our server and she was a sweetheart! Can't wait to come back\n","before Super cute place. Have lived in this neighborhood my whole life and wish I found it sooner. Very intimate. Would love to come back and do a date night on Thursday when wine bottles are half off. Kinda pricey other than that no complaints. Had the drunken noodles soo good!\n","before Didn't want to come back but my friend insisted because she loves this place and I'm glad I have it another shot. My nails came out great and service was good as well.\n","before Love the ambiance super cute. Doubt we will be back prices are super high for a hamburger $17 is crazy. Maybe if service was up to par it wouldn't have bothered me so much.  Food is good but overpriced.\n","before Love this place!!! As a Bears fan I love havering a place to go and watch he game with other local bears fans!! The food is always awesome and they have the freshest oysters!!!\n","before My wedding is next month in October and I have been working with Jeannie since this past January to find the perfect gown for me. She has been nothing less than amazing!!! She returns all my calls\\/emails, and is just so willing to help with whatever I need. It has been an absolute joy working with her. Would recommend her business to anyone!! Thank you Jeannie for all your hard work and help\n","before So glad I came across this place! Donna did my gel manicure and it was perfect. I felt like she really took her time to make sure they looked good. I will definitely be back and recommend this to place!\n","before Came across this place Sunday night when I was craving pizza but everything was about to close since it was already after 9pm. And luckily this place also delivered!!! After looking at the pictures I caved and called. We ordered the sampler appetizers, and the 17in pelligrini pizza with extra cheese. And if you spent $25 or more and mentioned yelp you got a free dinner salad. The food was good out appetizers were a little burnt but that big of a deal and I didn't feel like we got extra cheese. The dinner salad was super fresh and actually ended being my favorite thing! So happy we came across this place on yelp and we will definitely be ordering from here again\n","before I have lived in Vegas since I was 7 and have never trusted anyone to touch my hair. I'm mixed and have curly hair when wet. And I have just felt that growing up out here no one really knew how to handle my hair. Finally after years of contemplation I decided to find a hair dresser. After reading tons of reviews on many different places I found this salon and Maggie!!! She is a God send, so sweet and professional. I'm beyond excited I found someone that I trust to do my hair!! I saw her last month and already booked another appointment!\n","before I was soooo disappointed in this place!! I actually work at a teppanyaki restaurant so I was excited to try a new location. We went last Tuesday the 21st. There were two other tables being cooked at the time we arrived. Our server was Ramo, and at first we weren't sure if he was new or not because he seemed so disconnected and aloof. We probably waited 20min before we were even brought waters, and it was another gentleman that brought it I believe his name was Shane. He on the other hand was on top of everything, wherever our server slacked he made up for it. We waited maybe close to an hour before our chef came out and James was delightful! Like I said working this type of restaurant I've basically seen the typical show, but James did some things I haven't seen before and made it enjoyable. The food I honestly wasn't crazy for, it lacked a lot of flavor and their sauces desperately need a makeover. I really feel like the menu is way over priced. And especially for the type of service that was provided. I even ask for another glass of wine and never received it. I doubt we will get return, but I do know anyone wanting to try it out I will recommend they request James he was the best part of that place! And Shane was awesome too!\n","before Came in last night because we had time to kill before our movie. Jovany was our server, and he was AMAZING!! It was super busy, but he managed to make sure everything was perfect, our glasses were never empty, and our chip basket stayed full. All of the staff that we had some sort of interaction with were very friendly.\n","before Love love love the grain bowls this what I come here for. The apple kale slaw is good too. I haven't tried any of the other foods. Only negative is I feel like all the girls that work there have attitudes, and look like they hate their job.\n","before This place is great for families with younger children. My son loved this place except for our latest visit. We went two weeks ago and he was just kind of like \"okay mom can we go now I'm too old for this now\" and he's only 6. Just sucks there a tent more for families to do out here\n","before The food is always decent when we come, except the last visit we had; the fish wasn't that fresh. And I like to feel like I know what I'm talking about when it comes to fish since I work in a Japanese restaurant that sells sushi as well. I would give a four for food, but they lose a point for service. It's never really busy when we visit, but severs seem to be confused and dazed. They never really know what's going on. Other than that it's a decent ayce right down the street\n","before Came in the other night with a group of friends, we had time to kill after a wedding and we were waiting on the reception. The waitress was very attentive, each couple ordered chicken fingers to share and it was plenty of food, and the best chicken fingers I've ever had! Wish this place wasn't so far from where we lived or we would come back ASAP!\n","before Vic \u0026 Blue are the best!!!Vic \u0026 Blue are the best!!! Great costumer service, and amazing personalities. Never fails they know my order whenever I walk in.\n","before This is our go to spot when ever where in the area shopping. We even travel to this one instead of the one by red rock which is actually a little closer to where we live. Staff is always friendly and servers are amazing! I don't think we have come across anything on the menu we didn't enjoy. I love the members reward program and how when they scan our card they have little notes like get a child's menu or they can make a note of any known allergies for future reference.\n","before Love this spot!!! Amazing happy hour deals and great service. Been twice in the past two days and the bartender Mitch has taken great care of me! Bloody Mary's are out of this world! I'll have to come back and try the ribeye!\n","before I will start off the only reason this place gets two stars is because of the staff. The gentleman at the front was so polite and friendly suggested plenty of things to try. Once inside and seated we were greeted by two servers taking care of us I don't remember their names. They were very friendly and accommodating. My husband and I started with a caprese salad, and the diver scallops. The salad was lacking basil, but he scallop were superb. For our entree we ordered the bone in ribeye and the large filet mignon. We ordered both medium rare, unfortunately they both came back over done my husbands was about med-well and mine was med-medwell. We told our servers and the apologized and offered to make another one but we didn't feel like dealing with the hassle of waiting more. Oh!!! And the sauce they pour over the steak is awful is taste like gravy. I'm sorry if I wanted a meatloaf I would have ordered that and not a $60 steak. I understand all places have off nights but if your going to charge that much for a cut of meat then they should know how to cook it properly. Midrare and they make it midwell is a problem. But at the end of it they offered us free dessert. Again service was great but food was not much to be desired. Da part is my husband was telling his host about he issues and he said he has been getting so many complaints about the food there. Hopefully they can fix the issue because with the service they have potential.\n","before Enjoy this place the most out of all the restaurants at the rampart. Service is awesome and everytime we go I get something different, and have never been disappointed.\n","before We went look for a place to eat after church this afternoon and glad we stumbled upon this spot!! No wait. Such a cool ambience. I would love to come back during the evening while a band is playing and check out the scene then. The food was great!! We came with a party of 10 and everyone's food was perfect. I got the fish and chips, I have never had fish battered the way they did it but it is my new favorite! And the fries are out of the world good! I wish I knew my servers name cause he was super sweet! We will be back for sure!! Keep up the awesome job!\n","before The food portions are big and for a really great price. The reason for the three stars is for the poor service. Went in earlier this evening with two girlfriends and a total of three children. (We sat in the dining area) didn't seem very busy and there were two servers in the section. As soon as the waitress came over I felt like she was immediately irritated. She was very short with us and didn't seem to want to be bothered with us. We ended up coming to the conclusion it was because we had children with us. But I'm a little perplexed because they have a children's menu so she should be use to having families come in with kids. All three children were well behaved no screaming, crying running around or causing a scene to warrant such coldness. She would walk by and check on the other tables around us and pass us by. We all felt as if we really had to stare her down to come over and then when she would she was gone before we could finish what we were trying to say to her. Disappoints me because it's two min from my house. Maybe I'll try to come back with my husband and leave our son at home. But either way we are paying costumers and had well behaved children. We should have been treated with the same curtesy as the next guest.\n","before Food was okay. I feel like this place was overrated especially for the prices. Not in a rush to return\n","before Live down the street from this place and have been wanting to try it for years now, especially being from Chicago. It's a lot smaller than I anticipated I guess I thought it was going to look more like yardhouse on the inside. Menu isn't too big. We started with the brew house fries and the 10in pizza from happy hour. The portions were so big I couldn't order an entree so I just got a side salad which was also large. My husband got the south side cheese steak. We also got the sampler of all nine special beers they had going on. And the large glass on the table you can buy for $10 and pay an extra $5 to have them fill it up! 50oz of IPA and we get to get the glass sounds like a deal to me! Service was very friendly. Will defiantly be back!!\n","before I was really excited to try this place after reading the reviews and it's fairly close to home. Upon entering the cashier was very friendly and helpful since we had never been before. We decided to dine in, and the young lady said she would bring our food as soon as it was ready. Once she brought our food I realized she had forgot our ranch no big deal except she only gave me one and I ask for another since we had two meals. She explained that would cost extra, so I ask then why would you ask if I wanted ranch when I ordered. She ended up giving it to me at no extra cost. I was just a little annoyed by that. The wings were nice and hot and had plenty of meat. And I was pleasantly surprised that the boneless wings were so tasty!! Normally I stay away from boneless because they are breaded so much and there's no meat; but not here!! I was a little disappointed to find the French fries were hot since the wings seemed to be so fresh. And next time if your not going to clean your celery at least cut off the dirty parts before serving to costumers. Thank god I didn't see the dirt until I was basically done eating or that would have ruined my appetite, seeing how they were on the side of my wings. Over all decent place I will be back to try again.\n","before Came in yesterday for a late lunch with my girlfriend, this time we dined on the patio with our fur babies!! Service was awesome, Danny took really great care of us!!! And food was great like last time. Cannot wait to come back when the weather is a little cooler for the dogs.\n","before Came in today to order balloons for my sons party. Jazmine and Izzy were so helpful, not to mention super sweet. Costumer service was awesome.\n","before I purchased a Groupon for the Holiday Light Tour for me \u0026 my mom. It was actually for her 60th birthday. Thought it would be a fun night out. I am hard pressed to find much good to say. I think the bus is cool, but it just didnt have much to offer. There was zero Christmas cheer. Just seemed like getting on a public bus. Noone took or asked to even look at our tickets. We could have just walked on. I found that weird?! The lady that was in charge seemed very pleasant, but not really aware of anything. Noone told us anything. It was just really strange. The christmas music only played during our first place. The first place was cool. A neighborhood where everyone seems to be decorating big! Second stop is one you get out. When we got back on, someone had taken our seats, so we had to get down the little stairwell to sit, but before we did the bus took off! My mom isnt very steady on her feet.. I felt terrible for her. It was embarassing \u0026 dangerous. On the last stop you go into the home. We were probably there about 10 minutes (my mom is obsessed with taking photos ) but when we came out...no bus! They left us behind! No word from anyone they were leaving, no set time to leave..just gone. I was so sad. This was supposed to be a special night \u0026 it ended up being void of any joy. \n","\n","The reason I am giving 2 stars \u0026 not just one is that the owner saw fit to refund us for our tickets \u0026 give us a couple of tickets for a future event (not sure if I can ever get back on that bus!) But, in fairness, it could have just been an isolated incident \u0026 the management staff was very nice. \n","\n","In my opinion, just take your own car. Much cheaper \u0026 noone can leave you behind!\n","before Get here, by any means necessary. Its a beautiful restaurant, with the most incredible food \u0026 spot on service. Ive never ever tasted anything as good as the sticky toffee pudding. Ever. We also had the charred octopus (amazing), the tuna tartare (fantastic), the butternut squash gnocchi (incredible) etc.. (running out of adjectives). You should go now!\n","before I am so enamored with this place I am a lifetime member. I live nowhere near it and somehow find myself there every couple of months. The movie is cute and the pupa station interesting, but I breeze by. Because I need pure butterflies.\n","before First time eating here. Delicious deep dish pizza and cannolis!! Friendly service. Will definitely come back!\n","before My husband and I came here last weekend and we really enjoyed the food.  We had, Shumai Chicken Pad Thai, Char siu bao, the 3 types of meat, the bbq pork, duck and a delecious chicken that I can't remember the name of. \n","\n","The dumplings came out right away and were really good, better than general dim sum I feel like, especially the shumai.  Pad Thai was the more authentic type, more on the spicy side than sweet, with flat noodles.  Now I don't really like egg in most things, but the egg in this pad thai was seasoned and cooked perfectly.  The pork, duck and chicken were also really good, portions were great and we were both really full afterwards. \n","\n","I'm taking a star off mostly for the very small wine list. I would have loved more than two options for chardonnay, and its true, the service could have been faster, but we enjoyed the food so much I wasn't too worried. They also do not take reservations.\n","before The food is excellent. They have a great selection of dishes for vegans and non-vegans. On this visit we had the chicken burrito, basil fried rice, green thumb juice and sunrise juice. All was very good and I am extremely picky right down to the water they bring to the table. Water was filter. Service was good and very friendly. The decor is fantastic. It is a classy spot for daytime lunch meetings that easily transitions to a late night hotspot. They have a nice size patio in the back. A fantastic drink selection. Self service water station for filtered, reverse osmosis, and sparkling water. They even sell cigars to enjoy on the patio after 10pm. And a must have in my book to get a full 5 star rating... a clean bathroom.\n","before Orders GF French toast, 2 scrambled eggs and coffee for $15. Very filling and yummy breakfast. Awesome to sit in the courtyard and relax\n","before Was excited to try a brewery here. Excited to see a mostly empty bar. But...wtf. Need to be a man to get service at the bar. Two groups of guys walked up and got served right away. I made eye contact with two women bartenders. Then the male bartender. Nada. Wtf. Spending my money elsewhere\n","before Law Office of James E. Novak; James Novak is a former Prosecutor and is a respected member of the Bar. He is nationally known for his books on DUI Defense, and determination to battle for his clients.  James is active in the Bar, and manages several legal networks on G+ where attorneys share information, and discuss topics of interest to lawyers. James is easy to work with, and he will work hard for you. I highly recommend him to you. It is a pleasure to know him, and he serves the people of Arizona well.\n","before Owner is never present. Yard is failing, we pay for weed removal, Bush trimming, leaf blowing , aeration seed, you the usual package  but for everything we pay then for we have to stay on top of them and call to have it done because they use multiple crews for different jobs which is unheard of, normally one crew does it all.  Very incompetent, going downhill and it's a part time job trying to manage our landscapers, this is what they r paid for but they don't have their stuff together to perform what they r hired to do. They r also understaffed!!  Find another company, and some advice is to find an owner operator landscaper, they care because they come to your house instead of hiring people who don't care as much.\n","before The pork chop was juicy, tasty, and cooked to perfection. Mac and cheese side was not overwhelming, but had just the right combination of spices, which made it excellent as well. And the sticky toffee pudding for dessert was an unexpected and amazing surprise. Absolutely delicious. Service was extremely nice and competent. Cocktails were varied and did not try excessively hard. A great place overall.\n","before I dont recommend this lady at all, DON'T waist your time she is so rud, she has an attitude of a bulldog, I dont know how is she in business, my assitant bought a mani and pedi in groupon for my birthday so I got there on time, she told me on the ph the business name is NBN salon but theres nothing to show that around the building, the name on the side window is Nails Studio,  theres 4 suites and the rings dont have any tags (kind of hard to find it) so i finally made it in and with the most meaning attitude you can imagine she told me is going to be 1.5 hrs wait take it leave it,  you can reschedule I was thinking why is she talking like that... without looking at me at all and how can she play with people's time like that, I could be at my sons soccer game, so I respectfully and almost afraid of her response I said I will reschedule but next time you need to let me know  the exact time I can be seen because I'm on a schedule, OMG it was like I told her some racist comment, she stopped doing her clients nails, (she finally look at me and just picture a mean black lady with an ugly attitude) she started to go on and on  .... I was terrorized it is amazing how she welcomes new clients, I usually don't do reviews but I hope if your reading this I'll save you from having a disturbing experience, this is the worse experience I've had in my life. 1 start is too much.\n","before Excellent food choice. Yesterday I called in an order a pizza for pick up, got there and they mess up my order, the manager was very truthful and said your order wasn't keyed in by mistake and he apologized. I said its ok we made mistakes, Im on my way to drop my kids to the movies I dont have much time what do you got ready?  he looked at me and ask me ... what was your pizza give me a few mins Ill have it ready, we don't have pizzas sitting around, I said okay do what you have to do, he sure did... he cashed me out and he was preparing the pizza quickly...after 7 mins flat  he gave me the pizza, and also breadsticks for free, a couple drinks on the house because he knew I had my rugrats hungry in the car waiting for pizza, and he also gave me a coupon for 1\\/2 off. Their customer service is outstanding. we all make mistakes and he was showing great character and Im not saying it because he got me freebies but he was an excellent human being.\n","before 3 days straight. Can't get enough! Just the way I like my katsu. Mmmm sooooooo goooood :)\n","before Came here during the halftime of the football game I was watching next door at All-American Pub and was surprised at how fast they took my order and served it to me. Real fast service even while they were busy.\n","\n","I simply had tacos which were good. \n","\n","I ordered, ate, paid, and was able to get back to the game in time to watch the rest of the game so that worked out really well. Can't ask for more\n","\n","Fast service, good food :)\n","before Stopped here for lunch uptown and had a cheese and barbecue chicken pizza. Both pizzas were real good and the service was good too. The wait was average and they served you at your table when your pizza is ready. Since its called Fuel Pizza, the entire place is designed like a gas station. Pretty cool and different.\n","before I love places that let me schedule my reservation through OpenTable. Makes life that much easier. When we arrived we had valet parking out front which was seamless and when we got in, we were seated immediately. Service all around was great. \n","\n","The food was good. My wife had the steak, but she thought it could have been cooked better when it comes to cooking it medium well. I some fish and shrimp, that was ok. It was good enough to eat but the fish didn't have enough flavor.\n","before Freedom park is a really nice park. Its made for a running, biking, soccer\\/football fields, tennis, football, baseball and also has 2 or 3 playground areas for kids. They have the bike sharing b cycles and an area for a small stage for live music performance. The reason it doesn't get five stars from me is because it doesn't have any basketball courts for me to show off my Jordan skills lol.\n","before Dennys level food at Bouchon level prices. All this would be okay, given the convenience and location inside the casino except for the super slow service. Our two omelettes took over 25 min and the toast was cold by then. Not worth it IMO.\n","before Super slow front desk check-in. How hard is it to swipe the priority card and get a signature? Also location is not ideal - at the extreme end of the terminal by gate E2. Also hair in my cup of diet coke from the bar... :'(\n","before Thank you to Christopher and the talented jewelers who replicated an heirloom earring.  The quality of the service and the resulting product make this my go to Jeweler. My engagement and wedding rings havent looked this good since the day I got married 10 years ago.\n","before Not so much tex-mex as it is authentic regional Mexican cuisine, Cantina is a welcome treat in Charlotte.  Coming from California where traditional Mexican is common and delicious, I was a little disappointed in Mexican fare here - until I found Cantina 1511.  I'll definitely be back!\n","before I chose Diva Lashes initially because they had amazing reviews and was fully expecting to have to work my schedule around having my eye lashes done. But then I found out they have Sunday hours!!! Plus plus plus!!! Heather did my lashes...she was personable and great at her job!!! My lashes look amazing! I'll definitely be back! Highly recommend!!!\n","before Highly recommend! This is the second time my husband and I have gone here for mani\\/pedi's. Both times they did a great job! The last time Nikki did my manicure and pedicure...they look great and lasted a long time! She also waxed my eyebrows which I am super picky about and she did an awesome job! I will definitely be requesting Nikki every time in the future!\n","before Decided to check out a new salon in Tempe and I'm glad I did! Nicole was able to get me in the same day I called and she did an amazing job cutting and styling my hair! This new salon is super cute and the owner Nicole was very friendly and personable! I will definitely go back to her again! Thanks Nicole!\n","before I never write bad reviews (this is my first) but this place is horrible!!! Worst service and even worse management! First of all this is the 5th chance we gave them to get our order right because we do enjoy their food. They are 0-5. Each time we just placed an order for pick up and \"EVERY\" time (no exaggeration) there was something missing from our order. Either the salad, the bread or the cheese cake we ordered each time. The first time they told us to come back and get our salads...well we live over 30 minutes away so they refunded our credit card. The second time the bread was missing...we just let it go. The 3rd time...our cheese cake was missing. Is this a joke? Nothing worse than thinking you are going to have a nice piece of cheesecake with a glass of wine after dinner only to find out...once again you paid for something they forgot to pack. The fourth time we learned our lesson and checked the bags before we left the restaurant. Yep...once again they forgot the cheesecake. They got our cheesecake...no apologies...we left. The last and final time we will ever go there was on Monday 9\\/18\\/17. We got there right when the Monday night Giants game started. Again we just wanted to place an order to go as always. It took about 15 minutes to get a drink order and place our food order. It took another 10 minutes to actually get our drinks. Right before half time (yep it took that long to get a to-go order) the manager on duty brought us our bags of food. I politely asked if he wouldn't mind checking to make sure everything was there as we had problems getting everything we ordered the last 4 times. He said \"I know everything is there because I packed it myself\" and was very adamant about it. He then started rattling off what was in each bag. When he was done my husband said where's the cheese cake. The manager then ran to the back to get our two pieces of cheesecake. He handed them to us explaining that the dessert order go to a different area of the the kitchen so that's why that happened. Again just excuses...no apologies. It took forever to get our food order, which was incomplete again, and we were never asked if we would like another drink while we waited. The least he could have done was take the cheesecake off our bill. If you want horrible service with an attitude this is the place for you. Everybody needs more training there especially management!\n","before I so wanted to like this place.  We came in as a group of 8 20-somethings around 6 on a Sunday.  Place was busy, cool atmosphere, and with the photos we saw on yelp thought it would be a winner.  However, 3 out of 4 items i saw via photo were either discontinued or only offered during lunch.\n","\n","Not saying the \"bar style food\" was bad but disappointing for its variety and price.  \n","\n","Beer selection was ok, with a few chosen by our parties numerous flights as being too nasty to drink.  And that is saying a lot for our beer aficionados.  \n","\n","Odd note: lots of flies.  Kind of a turn off having 5 swarming around us.  Tough to control i know.\n","before My friend and I shared fish \u0026 chips and shepherd's pie. The fish was excellent. We ended up ordering more! I didn't enjoy the taste of the shepherd's pie but my friend loved it. Beware- it is served piping hot straight from the oven! \n","\n","They have all you can eat fish on Saturday.\n","before I'd never had Cambodian food before eating here and I will definitely go back! We started with the chicken \u0026 shrimp spring rolls. A little minty but very delicious. For the main course, I ordered the grilled pork chop. My friend ordered the lemon grass chicken. We split the dishes and were glad we did! Both were excellent. \n","\n","My two vegetarian friends were with me and the chef had no trouble adjusting menu items so they were veggie friendly. They both had veggie spring rolls and one ordered the student noodles. She raved about both. \n","\n","The only downside was service was a little slow. There was only one waitress and one cook. Bring your patience with you!\n","\n","One last thing...there are some mentions on here about BYO. They now serve beer and wine.\n","before Eh. I really don't see what all the fuss is about. I think Cornish Pasty is trendy and that's why people are flocking yo it. I ordered the chicken pot pie pasty. It was just all right, a little dry though. It did have chunks of chicken and a decent amount of veggies. I left most of the crust on my plate. I thought it was bland.\n","before This is a decent spot for lunch. We went to the McDowell Mtn location. They have a great patio with mountain views. I ordered the grilled chicken BLT. The chicken was moist and tasted good. I chose mac-n-cheese as my side. OMG...it was fabulous! I'm definitely ordering that as a main course if I go back again.\n","before Good place for lunch and reasonable prices. I ordered the California roll \u0026 shrimp tempura. It cones with Miso soup. All was delicious. My friend ordered the Ahi tower, which is like Ahi Poke. She raced about the Ahi, said it's one of the best sushi places in town.\n","before This is a pretty good place for lunch. The food is good and the portions are generous. I would stick with the traditional Chinese menu items and stay away from the Thai selections. I've had much better Thai elsewhere.\n","before This is a very small restaurant with no ambience but  great food. There are a little over 12 tables so be prepared when you walk in. There's also some seating at the bar. On the plus side, they do accept reservations, which I had. \n","\n","We ordered the causa rellena with crab. Although flavorful, it was served cold. We also ordered the frites which were excellent. \n","\n","For the main course, I ordered frijol con seco a la norteno. It's served with rice and beans. My friend ordered the pork chop. Both dishes were excellent. \n","\n","Be prepared for slow service and a relatively long wait time for your food. When I went, there was one waitress and one cook.\n","before This place is okay, as far as bar food goes. Lots of TVs, OTB and juke box. For happy hour, we ordered Jake's boneless wings and 1 dozen GOAT wings. The boneless wings were dry as toast. GOAT wings were pretty decent. \n","\n","Wait staff courteous and prompt.\n","before Ocean Trail never disappoints. They have a variety of Cajun style food. You can order gumbo or pan roasts with either white or dirty rice. One dinner meal is enough for two people, the portions are that generous. You can specify the level of spiciness, on a scale of 1-10. I order the shrimp pan roast with a spiciness of 4. That's about medium spice level. \n","\n","The restaurant is right on the casino floor so it's pretty noisy. There is limited seating, with about 6 tables and about 15 seats around the bar. It gets busy on weekend nights, with long lines forming. Get there early, about 6ish to get seated quickly.\n","before The WORST service ever! I will NEVER COME back again!!!\n","\n","We were a group of 7 persons! We get our foods very late and it was at least 5 min delay between bringing each one of them!\n","They even FORGOT one of our friend's order!\n","\n","The food that I got (ash reshteh, kashke bademjun) was not really delicious in my opinion but my friends liked it! \n","\n","The music was bad according to most of my friends but I liked it!\n","before The service was superb! The owner (Habib) himself was serving us during lunch hours! He was super nice and very friendly! It has a great ambiance with nice tables and dishes! GREAT for large groups! Not expensive in vegas scale and the food is also very good!\n","\n","Tips for Kabob Expert : \n","We had joojeh and soltani and all of them was good in LA standard, very good in Midwest and DC standard and excellent in east coast (boston and ny) standard ! \n","The only hilariously bad part was the xaz playlist ! :D\n","before I eat at Chima's once a month. Good place if your hungry. Never disappoints. It took me a couple of times to understand what is the best thing to eat. You don't want to stuff your self with bunch of salad or sausages.

Deep fried corn is awesome.\n","before The place is nice. Free valet is great. The entrees are the worse in the city. I've been there about 8 times. I get gift cards and I have tried almost everything. Please don't waste your money. If you have to go. Order the appetizers, they are awesome. Steaks are the worse. Their deep fried lobster tail is a joke. Not worth mentioning the rest. Great place for cocktails.

Then I'm gonna build a wall to keep the people from Madison out and I'm gonna make Madison pay for it. - DT\n","before I went here today for a pedicure along with a brow and lip wax. The pedicure was fabulous it was very relaxing and my feet looked amazing but the brow wax was disappointing after the brow wax I had to tell the lady to pluck several stray hairs that were obvious to the naked eye. I also had to ask her to trim the top of my brows these are things an experienced cosmetologist  should recognize even with me gently guiding her she still did not understand  I gave up and finished the rest of my brow job at home!!! For me to be a novice I think I did a pretty darn good job. The only other thing that was frustrating is that the owner or manager was talking on the phone loudly in her native language this is supposed to be an upscale nail salon and that distracted from my relaxing experience on a positive note though the location of the nail salon is beautiful!! Even after all of that I still tipped 15%...\n","before First and foremost I have been to Cantina 1511 before and the food and service has always been fantastic but today I went and had a horrible experience. I decided to stop in by myself to order some food, once I was seated and placed my order I went to the restroom to wash my hands why is it that a waitress that wasn't mine cleared my appetizer and drink from my table? She brought me out another one and said she was sorry so I let it go, but when my food came out I found debris in it, the waiter stated that he would have another plate remade for me so when the next plate came out there was a long piece of hair wedged in the meal, needless to say my appetite was destroyed and I left the restaurant, Cantina 1511 is definitely off my eating list.\n","before I decided to try something different tonight and ventured out to try this place. The staff was very friendly and accommodating. I ordered the white fish tacos which were absolutely delicious! Compared to most Tex Mex places its a little more expensive with slightly smaller portions. I will most definitely go back to this place.\n","before I went here last night on the hunt for a late night meal and I was impressed! (For those who don't know this location used to be Fox and Hound in Downtown Charlotte) I was warmly greeted and quickly seated. I ordered the veggie fajitas and a Raspberry Lemonade Martini. Both were absolutely delicious. The food portion is plentiful and the prices are very reasonable. Surprisingly this place served a full menu which is awesome considering most places offer a limited menu late at night. If you like to watch sports this is the place to go to there are a ton of televisions. Beautiful restorations have also been completed to this place making it more contemporary. This place is definitely worth a visit if you've never been!!!\n","before Before I explain the customer service experience I had with a rep. at this location I want to clarify that this experience is for a rep. by the name of Sandra. What should have been a simple package transaction turned into a nightmare. After waiting in line for over 15 minutes Sandra was the rep. that was supposed to help me with mailing a package. I could not locate the appropriate mailing label and asked for assistance and was met with a disgruntled employee with the most horrendous attitude I've ever experienced. She proceeded to talk condescending to me, when I advised her that I felt she was acted rudely and unprofessional she went on to say that \" Y'all expect us to do everything\" \" If y'all would just learn to read the labels\" I was puzzled this is a woman that is supposed to help provide customer service and she was openly complaining about her job description. To make matters worse she not only insulted me but the other customers that were around because they were subjected to her vile attitude and remarks. Since Sandra was not able to assist a customer in line was kind enough to look with me for the appropriate label even she had trouble finding it initially. I have been doing business with the USPS for over 13 years and have never had a problem. The experience here was so horrible that I will never come back to this location it was just that bad. When I was here I requested to speak with a manager but Sandra rudely stated \"she's not her today\" I asked for her managers name and she provided it so quickly which tells me that she has not only had complaints before but even worse that management is not addressing her scathing behavior. I've always had so much respect for this institution and its employees but I have lost so much faith in the post office's ability to provide any future services for me. It is my request that Paris Cherry address Sandra's customer service skills so that another customer never has to go through what I through today.\n","before I usually check out sunrise for breakfast but decided to try them out for dinner and I was not disappointed. First and foremost I love the old school diner vibe. The customer service is friendly and it's nice to eat at a place where the regulars eat daily that really says something about a place. I ordered the salmon cakes with a side of mustard greens and pinto beans!!! The salmon cakes were awesome fresh and crispy the pinto beans were to die for along with the greens that were seasoned to perfection. The cheese cake for dessert was awesome sweet and creamy and the best part the prices are reasonable!!!!\n","before This is a nice cozy bar tucked away in a shopping center unless you were looking for this place you wouldn't notice it. I went here one evening for a late night snack I ordered the vegetarian chili which was amazing and reasonably priced for a late night spot I was impressed with their vegetarian options this place also has nice live music from local bands .\n","before Yes!!!! I lucked out and found another awesome diner!! Again I love places like this it seems to have an at home  nostalgic feeling. I ordered a vegetable plate and was very satisfied . The prices are very reasonable. The staff is very welcoming and friendly I will definitely be back!!!\n","before Good tacos, quick service and cheap prices . I ordered two of the lengua tacos that was good but not great they made them fresh to order and the location is pretty convenient probably wouldn't go again but it's worth a try.\n","before This was my first time trying Ethiopian food and I must say that I was not disappointed . This place is located off Central and it's easy to miss if your not paying attention the outside looks shabby but the inside is beautifully decorated with Ethiopian art and decor. Our server was very friendly and helpful in explaining the menu! The food is cooked fresh and is phenomenal. I ordered a vegetarian lentil dish with cabbage and green beans the dish is good and the cabbage is amazing. I also treated my self to freshly brewed Ethiopian coffee p.s. This place makes a nice place for a\n","cozy intimate date !\n","before This review is an update from my previous review, however before I write my updated review I want to give major kudos to the General Manager Marc Habbouche. Upon seeing that my first dining experience at the restaurant was not pleasant he reached out to me right away to resolve the matter. That says a lot about this establishment and shows me that not only does Burtons Grill \u0026 Bar value feedback from their customers but they take their reputation as a fine dining establishment seriously.. So now I'm going into my updated review. Upon me and my guest arriving to the restaurant the hostess greeted us with a smile and promptly seated us at a booth. Not long after our server Josh came out and went over the menu with us. The one thing that rocks about Burtons is that they have something on the menu to appease everyone and if you have a food allergy they will accommodate your specific dietary needs. As an appetizer I settled on the Fried Green Tomatoes that came with a side of homemade pimento cheese. The appetizer was freshly made and simply amazing not to mention that the pimento cheese is made fresh in the kitchen and has the right out of spicy kick to it that was perfect. I also ordered a drink called the Spicy Paloma and my guest had a Spiked Summer Slush both of our cocktails were awesome. As for my main entree I ordered the Thai Bowl and it rocked it was the perfect combination and sweet and spicy I eat vegetarian so I really love how their has a dedicated vegetarian section on the menu. Lastly to top it I had a dessert that knocked my socks of it was a combination of three delicious cakes\\/ pudding dessert, one was chocolate with by the way is Gluten Free another was a creamy cheese cake desert with blueberries and another was a caramel flavored dessert. Overall my dining experience was a complete 180 compared to the last time I dined with Burtons , not only was the ambiance and food top notch but the staff is very friendly and accommodating also the General Manager Marc Habbouche come out to greet me at my table personally he made me feel right at home, I was also greeted by the Assistant Manager Taylor and when you go to this place make sure to request Josh as your server he's awesome! Josh had a pleasant demeanor and really personalized my dining experience and checked back on me and my guest frequently and made sure that we were very well taken care of! If you are looking for great food with a beautiful ambiance with a personalized dining experience please be sure to check out Burtons! I'll surely be back! Thank you for making my dining experience a memorable one!!!\n","before I drifted in here on a rainy day, this a nice cool spot with healthy tasty options. I tried the Vegetable Pho which was very good, it came with nice chunks of tofu, noodles, vegetables, and bean sprouts, its was simple yet tasty and very filling. On the downside it seemed to take quite a while for my soup to arrive. The people that run the restaurant are very friendly and welcoming.\n","before I've been to this place so many times I can't believe that I never reviewed their food. This is a cool take out place ran by a married couple from Thailand. You can't dine in but the food is fantastic. I love their \"Pud Thai\" with Tofu! It is so good and I always get it spicy I order mine at a level 4. The prices are very reasonable and the portions are huge.  If you are looking for good thai food check this place out!\n","before I went here on a Friday to get some grub before a movie on a Friday night. I was promptly greeted an seated and the waitress I had was very cheery and attentive ! I ordered the stacked nachos but warning if you order these you need at least 2 people to eat these! The portion is huge and the price was reasonable the bolt reason for the three stars is because the nachos tasted okay and kind of bland.\n","before I stopped in hear last Friday night with a friend on a whim. I was skeptical of this place since I have never heard of Jack Beagles, upon my party finding a table a waitress quickly came over to take our order. She was nice but her knowledge of the food menu and beers were very limited. I eat primarily vegan so I thought I wouldn't be able to find anything great to eat I was wrong!!! I had the Primavera vegetable Flat Wrap wish was absolutely delicious!! They also had a nice outdoor patio with a great band playing!!\n","before I went here anxious to try the lobster ravioli ! Me and my date were quickly seated and ordered the spicy calamari which was good and then our lobster ravioli arrived and it was disappointing it was too heavy on the Salt so my date and I had to send it back I then ordered the classic lasagna which was good . The server was very friendly and very accommodating that's why Olive Garden gets 4 stars..\n","before This was my first time going into a Vietnamese restaurant and I was very impressed! I went here for lunch and ordered the vegetarian lemongrass noodle dish! It was phenomenal. The ingredients were fresh and the service was great!\n","before I stumbled into this place over the holiday weekend and fell in love. This is a nice casual spot with a \"Cheers\" type of feel to it. The bartenders are friendly and the patrons are regulars. They don't have food but sell snacks they also have live music on certain days. The decor of the bar will really grab your attention it has a very tropical feel to it. When you go there be sure to \"roll the dice\" for 0.50 cent you get to roll two times if you get 4 of the same dice you win a 6 pack! If you get 5 of the same you when the cash in the jar from people who paid to roll the dice but have previously lost! I rolled and didn't win but who knows maybe one day...\n","before I love how this place offers tons of healthy options especially for vegans and vegetarian. On the downside though the menu is pretty extensive so it's a good idea to check out the menu before you go inside because it's healthy \"fast\" food. On a positive note the staff is very friendly and helpful. My salad was pretty good\n","before I stopped I stopped into this place on a whim and my tummy walked out happy! I was seated promptly and brought out three types of salsas the green one was the best\n","It's super spicy! After that I ordered two tacos. My tacos were awesome!! When I eat out I prefer to eat vegan so my tacos included lettuce, tomatoes, onions, refried beans, cilantro and guacamole! If you never been here check it out! Oh and by the way the prices are super reasonable!!!!\n","before I met someone here for lunch and thought I would write a review upon entering the restaurant we were quickly greeted and were seated promptly I ordered a chicken stir fry egg plant dish and substituted the chicken for tofu and the egg roll for a spring roll without meat the portions were decent and the prices are reasonable but the food was bland . They are vegan\\/ vegetarian friendly though and were more than happy to accommodate my dietary needs.\n","before I went to the Aveda Institute for the first time a couple of weeks ago and I must admit that I was very impressed. I went there for an eyebrow wax but the experience was much more than that. I was greeted upon arrival and the student performing my service was friendly, on time and very professional. My visit included a brow consultation to determine how I actually wanted my brows to look after the waxing and included aromatherapy. The prices are also extremely reasonable. Aveda insures your satisfaction even more by having the instructor to speak with you after your service so that you can critique your experience!\n","before I have been wanting to try this place after learning about the benefits of a raw food diet and after having lunch here I must say that this will be my go to place. I love the building that Luna's is located in plenty of windows for sunshine and beautiful hard wood flooring . This place has an ultra sleek big city metropolitan feel to it. I started my lunch with the falafel sampler and it was delicious it also came with a yummy hummus and delicious pickled vegetables. As my drink I tried the chai latte which is made in house it puts Starbucks to shame. As my main entree I had the Rawco Taco salad and thought I was in heaven . To top it all off I had dessert it was a pumpkin like cheese cake and it was amazing . Even if your not vegan this is a place that is a must try for everyone. The staff is friendly and the food is good for you and the planet ! It's a win win for everybody .\n","before I had an opportunity to check out the Masa Casa and was impressed. Because the tamales sold here are wildly the popular the one I tried was the only one left it was the Ghost Pepper Tamale and it was great! Not only are the ingredients organic, vegan and non gmo but the taste was phenomenal. I'm a fan of spice so it was quite delicious . They even have an array of homemade sauces that the can dip your tamale in. The only tip that I have is to arrive early because these tamales go quick. It's also feels good to support a local business that's provided tasty vegan food!!\n","before This is an average Mexican restaurant . This place isn't really worth visting. The staff seemed very un organized as I had three sets of people as me back to back what I wanted to drink. I ordered the vegetarian burrito the food was bland barely warm. The chips and salsa were decent . Skip this place and try another recommended Mexican restaurant on my list.\n","before 1900 Mexican Grill has mediocre food at gourmet food prices. The only great thing about this place is the location!\n","before This nice Italian restaurant is the perfect place for a cute date night with that special someone. The place is simple but the food is delightful. l love the Eggplant Parmesan it is absolutely delicious and enough to split with two people. Also if your looking to hang out after dinner this place is close to Plaza Midwood, Elizabeth and not far from Uptown!\n","before I ventured out to Einstein's to try something different for breakfast. I ordered an egg, spinach, and cheese on a whole wheat bagel with coffee.  I love the fact that this place offers healthy options however the food was very bland and overpriced 7 bucks for what I ordered is way too much.....\n","before Don't let the shabbiness of this place fool you! This is a true gem if you enjoy Mexican food. This place lives up to its great reviews when I came here it was a full house and the prices are reasonable. I ordered the chimichanga but to make it vegan I had them substitute the meat with vegetables and remove the cheese and sour cream . They were more than happy to accommodate my dietary needs which tells me this place makes their food fresh  ! If you haven't been here your missing out!!\n","before I ordered the quinoa salad that was okay but nothing special and a bit pricy for my taste based on the portion size. This is a great place though if your looking for a healthier eating out options. People that work here are\n","Friendly and helpful..\n","before I love this place. It has a great variety of organic produce at a reasonable price!! They also have a great vitamin and supplement section and a great juice bar and section to order your food. Every time I go in I feel more dedicated and determined to live a healthier lifestyle!\n","before I met a group of friends here and decided to give this place a try. I ordered a salad that was very good! It had Bibb lettuce, pears, candied walnuts, blue cheese, with an apple cider vinegar salad dressing! The service was great and this is also a great place to hang out with friends because you can play pool or sit outside. This place has plenty of space!\n","before To summarize the drinks are awesome, the service is terrific and the ambiance is beautiful\n","before I went to this place again last night and as always I am amazed. I love the location of this place it's nestled in the shopping center in the  shopping center where Fresh Market is located. The setting is very intimate and the decor is fantastic! For my appetizer I ordered the Thai Orchid Spring Rolls the rolls were crispy and delicious and came with a phenomenal peanut sauce. As my entree I ordered the vegetarian Pad Prik King with tofu and it was amazing I requested them to make it spicy and they were able to accomplish that! The dish was full of wonderful veggies in a creamy coconut curry sauce the dish came with rice! Normally I get the pad thai but decided to try something different and I was not disappointed! I would definitely recommend this place the staff is also very knowledgeable about the menu and very friendly the prices here are also fairly reasonable!!!\n","before If you are looking for good Asian food cuisine this is not the place to go to. The food is over priced \u0026 of poor quality. I went to Mama Fu's after work one evening for dinner and was very disappointed. When I entered the restaurant I was not greeted and to be frankly honest didn't know whether I needed to sit down at a table to have someone take my order or if I needed to go to the front counter to place my order. When I finally did figure out that I needed to go to the counter to place my order I sat down and waited for my food to arrive. The food arrived in less than five minutes and the server brought my food without bringing out eating utensils! When I asked the server for a fork she said \" Oh you do need a fork? \" Last time I checked civilized people do not eat a rice dish with their hands. When she did bring the fork and I was finally able to eat my food I realized that the food was luke warm and just plain tasteless ( I ordered the Red Thai Curry Dish) That particular dish was supposed to be spicy and had no taste what so ever. I left the restaurant sorely disappointed and $10.00 dollars poorer!\n","before Hands down this place has the best vegetable lasagna and eggplant parmesan. The prices are cheap and the food is plentiful. When I need a carb hangover this is where I go.\n","before How do can I describe La Paz? Well lets see, lousy service, below average food that is over priced in a trendy neighborhood that is the best description of this place.\n","before I absolutely love this dish but decided to step outside the box and try something different I ordered the southwest veggie burger without cheese with a side if black beans! The veggie burger was delish and had good spicy taste to it the black beans were cooked to perfection! As always the service is always friendly!!!\n","before The food here is great!! I was quickly seated the server was friendly the chips were warm and the salsa was pretty good. I ordered the vegetable chimichanga that was amazing .. My favorite part after the meal is that you are brought a cinnamon chip with whip cream and strawberry sauce . This place is one of my new favorite places..\n","before Tanners is a nice upscale bar spot with great food. The only issue that I've had is with some of the bar  tenders, they tend to move a little slow and not be very attentive to their patrons. Other than that it's a nice spot to grab a drink with your girls or with your man.\n","before If you haven't been to Pinky's Westside Grill you don't know what your missing! When I arrived I was warmly greeted and seated promptly! I ordered the nature boy burger ding song style without cheese and mayo with some hummus mixed in and I was blown away ! I also ordered the pinto bean salad that  was fantastic this place has a retro feel and is priced reasonably ! Check it out you won't be disappointed ! P.S. This place has ton of vegetarian options and almost anything can be made vegan by removing cheese or certain sauces!!\n","before Nestled away in a shopping center on W. Mallard Creek Rd. you will find this chic cafe abundant with delicious pastries, coffee and breakfast options. I ordered the brunch bagel but substituted the bagel for their warm tender flakey croissant and removed the bacon from my sandwich making my platter a delicious egg and cheese croissant with a side of strawberries along with crispy hash browns . The staff is very friendly and helpful . Victoria in particular went out of her way to assist me and my counter parts to make us feel at home  . This isn't your ordinary cafe though they have live music on some nights and have been know to have dinner nights revolving around a specific type of cultural food. If you haven't been here your missing out !\n","before I don't know what all the other bad reviews are about but I had Tres Pesos last night and was very satisfied. The chips and salsa brought out on the house were quite good. The chips were warm and the salsa was flavorful and spicy. I ordered the chimichanga but had them make it vegetarian style. Inside it was stuffed with re-fried beans, onions, bell peppers and mushrooms. on top it was layered with a nice cheese sauce. On the side my dish came with beans and rice with guacamole and sour cream with lettuce and tomatoes. I left happy and will definitely return!!!! On top of all of that my server was awesome!\n","before I went out to Outback for a light snack. I was seated promptly without any delays. My server was very attentive and helpful with the menu. I ordered the side salad along with the soup for the day. The salad was fresh and crisp and I promise they have the best garlic croutons. The soup was better than I expected it was a creamy onion and cheese soup. And of course they brought out their famous bread and butter!\n","before Decent food cheap drinks and a great place to catch a sports game. The servers are friendly and this is located in a great spot with plenty of parking.\n","before I've been living at Wildwood apartments since May of 2016 and so far I have been very pleased. I love the location of the apartments because it is close to the South Park area, close to Uptown and close to the trendy South End area. I also love the scenic view that my apartment provides as a bonus I get to see deer come out through out the day to eat vegetation. One other thing I wanted to mention is that the staff is fantastic, they are not only nice to you when you first move in but are very friendly way after the fact. If you are looking for a nice scenic apartment building inside of a nice residential area this is the place to be!!\n","before This morning I was up early and decided to treat myself to brunch I settled on Zada Janes which is located in the trendy neighborhood of Plaza Midwood this place is extremely popular b\\/c I waited about 20 minutes before I was seated and another 20 minutes before my food came out. I decided to try the \"basic breakfast\" I chose the eggs, soysage, whole wheat toast with a pancake, with sweet potatoe bites I must say that it was delish. The serving size was just enough to fill me up without being too full the waitress was also sweet and attentive. The only cons to this place was that there was no organization as far as checking into this place for brunch and the wait was a bit long other than that it will become a regular spot for me.\n","before I ended up here on a whim and I'm glad that I did. The decor of 300 East is beautiful and rustic. The staff was helpful and friendly and was very patient as I glanced over the menu.  I ordered the veggie burger with the season pumpkin Mac and cheese and my taste buds were delighted. I also ordered a side of the root vegetable soup with the goat cheese and it was phenomenal!!! This will be on my list for go to places in the future!\n","before Today for lunch I decided to try this place based on my boyfriend's suggestion that the food was fantastic, however I was slightly disappointed... I ordered the Perch dinner with macaroni and cheese and green beans with a corn muffin for my sides. For starters I didn't like the fact that this place charges .29 cents for tap water. The green beans were bland to me they tasted like canned green beans!!!! The Mac and cheese was just okay not bad or good and the perch was okay as well. The only great thing about the place was the workers friendly attitude. But here's my verdict lets just say that my boyfriend is suspended for choosing places to eat for a while....      :)\n","before I absolutely love Caribou Coffee especially this location because it's located in the beautiful South Park\\/ Fox Croft area! The baristas here are super friendly and if your looking for a nice place to study or get work done on your laptop this location is not too noisy it has a beautiful cozy cabin feel to it!\n","before I've been here a few times before but something is different and not in a good way.. I was quickly seated which was great but couldn't decide what I wanted so I decided to order one Mexican style taco I was told that I couldn't just order one or I would bd charged for chips and salsa I never encountered this before and I've been to several Mexican restaurant when my tacos did come out the tortilla shells were too greasy and I had to send it back the second time the tacos were better but forcing someone to spend a certain amount of money is just wrong I won't be back .\n","before I was taken here for dinner and was simply amazed. My dinner began with a creamy asparagus soup that was awesome with a  side of corn bread. The corn bread wasn't impressive but the soup was. My entree was the vegetable rotini dish and it was amazing! It had multicolored rotini pasta with sun dried tomatoes, mushrooms, asparagus, etc. all topped off with a dash of asiago cheese. I liked that the dish did not include a lot of cheese and it came with a side of rosemary bread. Our server was great and the atmosphere is nice and cozy!!!\n","before I went here today for lunch for my first time with a friend and being a vegetarian enthusiast I was very disappointed . Getting to this place was a huge hassle but what's worst was the service .. I ordered a Philly cheese steak sandwich with mushrooms and onions with a fry . When the food arrived I had my sandwich without the mushrooms or veganaise as I requested when I went in to\n","The store I informed a person that did not take my order of the mishap\n","She rudely stated we charge extra for what was missing on my sandwich but the person that originally took my order admitted to the mistake the lady was so rude and unfriendly that I didn't even want the meal she killed my appetite and I returned the food the lady gave me a refund and coldly told the nice person that originally had taken my order to throw my food away. So basically they lost what would have been a loyal\n","Customer over rude service and refunded 10  bucks instead of correcting a mistake that cost 1.00 I hope the owner of this place discusses the importance of customer service with the rude lady that spoke with me if they don't they won't be in business long not to mention the location is hard to find all I can say is best of luck to this business I spent my money elsewhere..\n","before I recently went to Bean to find out what all of the hype was about and was over joyed!!!!! The decor of the places is quite simple but the food is fantastic for those who think that since this is a vegan place that the food must be bland they are wrong!!!! Nothing can be further from the truth this is good vegan comfort food! I tried the crab patty sandwich with the tater tot casserole and it was fantastic. The sandwich was made with Jack fruit and I could not tell that it wasn't meat!  The tater-tot casserole was a nice switch from just fries as a side like most eateries. The next day I went and tried the pulled barbecue sandwich with the mega bean salad and just about lost it because it was so good. Check this place out and support it Charlotte needs more vegan\\/ vegetarian places.... P.S. Even if your not vegetarian or vegan you will love this place.\n","before I wondered into this place on a beautiful Saturday afternoon and fell in love. I ordered the veggie taco topped with guacamole and it was phenomenal!  The prices are very reasonable and I love the laid back atmosphere with the cool music. If you want to sit outdoors they have a beautiful patio where you can sit outside!\n","before After reading such rave reviews about this place I figured I had to check it out! The service here is fantastic! I was quickly greeted and seated. My server was also very knowledgeable about the menu. I ordered the vegetarian tostada and the spinach and cheese quesadilla both were delicious! The prices are very reasonable! I recommend this place if your looking for good inexpensive \"comfort food\".\n","before I decided to try this place on taco Tuesday since the tacos are only 1.00!!! I ordered two vegetarian tacos. The tacos were absolutely delicious they came on corn tortillas with your choices of beans and toppings!!! I also love this place because it is vegetarian friendly if you don't want meat you can get tofu which is a huge plus. You also get chips with access to the salsa bar. The chips provided to me were not so good they tasted over fried and oily the salsa bar was good though because it allows you the option to try a variety of salsas. I'm happy to say that I found a great place to grab Tacos on Tuesdays!!!!\n","before I went out lunch and was very impressed the service provided was top notch and the food was awesome I ordered the Pad Thai and the lettuce wraps and hot sour soup as an appetizer everything that came out was fresh and on point I think I just found another favorite spot.....\n","before I went to Vine Restaurant for a meeting with a group of friends.  Immediately I was impressed with the decor of the restaurant. I loved the way you could see the chef cooking the food from your table and the \"Barrel Room\" my group had which is a private room inside the restaurant was nice and cozy. instead of solid walls most of the room was surrounded by glass but you had the option to make it more private by closing the curtain. The food was also phenomenal! Our group had an opportunity to try several appetizers and wine.  My favorites are the Southwestern Guacamole which was chunky and tasty. The New Orleans BBQ Shrimp was fantastic the sauce that is placed over it is amazing. The Maytag blue cheese chips and  fried green tomatoes were great as well. The Vine also has a great wine selection. The food and the private room we had were amazing but none of this would have been possible without the server we had, her name is Alex and her service was on point from start to finish. She consistently checked on our group and had a pleasant demeanor and was very knowledgeable if we had questions about the menu. She also made sure that our glasses were always full and kept our group's table very organized. I was very pleased with the service Alex provided along with the food that was served. Let's just say that I'll be back to this place very soon! P.S. Thanks again Alex for making our experience at Vine memorable!\n","before McDonald's is McDonald's there's  nothing really special to say. Quick cheap food with a tolerable customer service. What's not to love?\n","before This place saved me a dryer I was using went out on a Saturday after 9pm and I was desperate to dry my clothes so that they wouldn't get smelly overnight and so that I wouldn't have to wash them again the next day. I love this place because they are open later than most laundromats and they are pretty clean and I don't see any people loitering. The only thing that I didn't like is that this place doesn't take cash you have to buy a laundry card for 1.00 and load money on it. Other than that this place is cool.\n","before I discovered this gem while bringing a special someone out here for a dinner date. The view is absolutely phenomenal since the restaurant sits right on the lake in a secluded setting. The decor of this place is great and I love this place because it is fancy food in a laid back setting. The server was awesome very friendly and very pleasant. Our food was just as great I had the tilapia dish with a salad and it was perfect. If your looking for a place with great food and a view this is the place to be.\n","before Landmark is definitely a favorite place of mine the service is good the food is plentiful and the prices are low, it's not a super fancy place but a good old fashioned diner..\n","before I went to Fusion Pizza to try out a new place. I love how their business and food is environmentally friendly, however I was not impressed by the food though. Quite honestly it was not good at all. I ordered the Greek Pizza and did not enjoy it. Not only that the food is grossly over priced for the amount of food that you get.\n","before I went here looking for late night grub on New Years Eve 2015 I didn't expect much being that this was a bar but I was totally surprised the food was delicious I ordered this fried fish tacos with a side of sweet potatoes fries which was excellent and perfectly portioned . On top of that my server was awesome ! He was kind and you could tell he liked his job it doesn't get better than that!!\n","before Today for lunch I had the pleasure of re-visiting The Kings Kitchen and I have to admit that their service has improved dramatically. When I arrived the staff here really rolled out the red carpet! I was warmly greeted and seated quickly. I started off with the sweet potato fritters which were quite amazing they came out with a side of honey they were the perfect appetizer . For my entree I ordered the catfish that came with three sides. I've never had catfish before and didn't know what to expect but when it came out I was in heaven ! The catfish was fried perfectly it was light and crisp but not greasy and flavorful for my sides I choose the Mac and cheese, seared cabbage and the butter beans that came a side corn bread and a biscuit everything thing hands down was good. When you come here for lunch come with an appetite . Now last but not least one thing makes this place special from any other place . This restaurant is a non profit that donates all of its proceeds and opens it's doors in the afternoon to feed the less fortunate in Charlotte! I had the pleasure of witnessing this first hand and it was beautiful to see the non profit in action. So if your looking for a great meal please support this place. Not only is the food fantastic but your contributing to a great cause. Eating out never tasted so good :)\n","before I tried this place after hearing from someone that they have authentic Mexican tacos. Being that I love Mexican food I knew I had to try this place. I had the Rajas Taco which was delicious along with the Papas tostadas. The corn tortillas are delicious and are made in house and the taco was great. My favorite though was the Papas tostadas it was so delightful to my taste buds to keep my food vegan I just ask them to remove the creamy cilantro sauce and cheese and topped my food with there red salsa sauce that was amazing! The only downside is the parking but other than that this is a cool spot!\n","before The food here is so good I'm surprised that no one has written a review for this place ! I ordered take out but next time I'm dining in judging the plates I saw coming out of the kitchen everything looked delicious . I ordered the bean burrito stuffed with grilled veggies it came with rice, a salad and guacamole . The food was amazing and portions are huge so come hungry . The prices are reasonable and this place stays open late !\n","before When I craving a good taco and don't want to spend an arm and a leg I check out this place. The Chips are not always the best but the salsas they bring out to the taco are fantastic especially the green avocado salsa but you have to ask for it. I ordered a vegetarian tostada it had re-fried beans, lettuce, tomatoes, onions, cilantro, and fresh avocado! It was absolutely delicious. The only downside is sometimes the menu changes and the hours varies depending on how busy they are.\n","before I went to this place for lunch yesterday to have the ribs since I always here people talking about great they are. The ribs were pretty good not the best I've had but decent the sides I ordered though were disappointing the Mac and cheese was flavorless and boring the green bean casserole was not good at all I didn't even finish it. On a positive note though the service was pretty good and the restaurant itself is pretty nice...\n","before I decided to check out this new spot and will definitely add it to my list of favorites! I love the decor it has a very much retro rock feel. The service was great and the food was fantastic. I ordered the fried avocado taco with the infamous corn as a side and boy was I in for a treat!!! The prices are reasonable and it's a laid back type of restaurant. Check it out if you haven't!!!!\n","before I stopped by Tic Toc Diner for breakfast today and was very pleased. I ordered the Western omelet with toast and hash browns and I must say that it was fantastic. I love the outdoor seating that is right on the street which makes this place a great way to start off your day!!! The only downside is that this place can be a bit pricey just for breakfast but its worth it!!!\n","before I finally decided to give Label another chance and I am very impressed. There's definitely more room to dance and the VIP section is awesome. The staff was friendly and helpful and the music selection was perfect if you haven't been to label recently you should definitely give it a second try!\n","before I love finding cozy restaurants that aren't huge conglomerates .  This is a nice cute diner where the regular customers drop in often. I ordered the vegetable plate which was amazing the cabbage and Lima beans were good but my favorite was the fried zucchini sticks they were so good I ordered an extra side of them. Also are waitress was sweet and attentive and on top of all that the decor is retro cool give this place a try it's nothing fancy just good home style cooking !\n","before This place is a great place to hang out. They have a limited but awesome selection of beer that they brew at their location. They also have live menu and a cool food selection. The location is a little off the beaten path but definitely worth checking out!\n","before I came here wanting to venture out and try a different Mexican restaurant l other than my usual favorites. This place is a little different sense it has a sports bar appeal. After I was sitting I was brought out the usual chips and salsa.  I wasn't impressed with the salsa u thought it was bland and the chips were cold. I ordered the vegetarian combo which included a bean burrito, cheeses quesadilla, and a chalupa. The burrito was bland but the chalupa and quesadilla were my favorite. My server was quick and attentive. I would rank this place as average nothing special.\n","before Went there to see The Butler and my experience was a good one! The place itself is beautiful and very classy and everyone was polite and greeted me upon entering the theatre and exiting it! I love the way the service is brought right to your seat all at the press of a button!\n","before I went here for a family lunch and was pleasantly pleased. We ordered a pizza half veggie and the other half cheese and I was in Pizza heaven. The service was fantastic and they have beautiful outdoor patio seating. If you haven't been here check them out!! Not to mention they have cool beer specials!!!!\n","before If your looking for authentic food this is the place to go to! It is not super fancy but the people who work here are very warm and friendly! I was brought warm chips and three different types of salsas that were very good! I ordered the bean wet burrito it was amazing!!! It was stuffed with refried beans, rice, cilantro, and onions, topped off with a good Red sauce and cheese and sour cream! I will definitely be back to this place !!!\n","before My wife and I found this place after searching for a place open this morning for a foot massage. We were pleasantly surprised. I must admit Aris gave me one of the best massages ever. Her technique and pressure was excellent. My wife enjoyed her massage as well with Carson. Definitely highly recommend the deep foot massage and hot stones were a great added touch. Visiting from FL it was surprising so many places here don't have any air conditioning running. But XY also had the AC on and it was a comfortable environment for the massage. We will be back!!! They are under new management so I wouldn't look at the older poor reviews.\n","before Knowing Cheesecake Factory, I personally try to steer away because of their food. Don't get me wrong. Their foods are mostly good but they also pack a punch in calories. So I was surprised when along with their regular menu, we were given a \"Skinnylicous\" one. It was so exciting! They listed all their food options and most of them are below 600 calories! Score!\n","\n","We ordered appetizers and I settled with the Skinnylicious burger. It was surprisingly good! You would think that something like that would be more than 600 calories at least. I am really glad that they have this option available. I might consider dining here again if I'm in the area and not be scared that I have no other options but unhealthy ones.\n","before This place is the best! I was thrilled when I learned that Bachi opened a location near where we live. I have been to all three locations here in Las Vegas and by far I like this location the most. \n","\n","1. I am impressed by how they maintained the quality of the food across all branches - kudos to the chefs!\n","2.  It does not get as crowded as the one on Windmill and Bermuda. \n","3. The interior is modern looking and well-lit compared to the other two locations. \n","\n","My favorite burger here is the Miyagi-san. I tried the other ones but I always come back to this one.  It's a juicy burger with crispy fried onion rings and fried egg with furikake seasoning. This one is just amazing. It's a perfect balance of crispy and savory flavors. The sweetness of the sauce is balanced out by the saltiness of the onion rings. Perfect marriage of food!\n","\n","I also love that they have the blackberry cider here. This one is such a rare find. It used to be called Fox Barrel but now it's called Crispin. It's my favorite cider and this is the only restaurant I know that serves them. Also, you must order the truffle parmesan fries. It's perfect every time. \n","\n","The service at this branch can use some improvement. We dined here one time (Saturday for brunch) and we had to wait for our food for over an hour. We were later informed that someone in the kitchen was in training so the food took a little longer than usual. Our food still came out perfect so I had no complaint. \n","\n","Aside from that, I highly recommend this place if you're in a mood for something new to try.\n","before This place is literally right next to our house. I ordered dinner here last night thru Eat24. It was so convenient and fast. \n","\n","However, I was informed later on when I picked up my order that if I order online, I am not eligible to get the (FREE) appetizers since there was no way I can tell them if I would like crab rangoons or spring rolls. They said if I called I can specify it. That was a bummer but I wish that would not always be the case. I'm thinking next time I would write that down at the \"Special Instructions\" section when checking out.\n","\n","They were very nice about and said that if I am willing to wait they can still get give it to me. I declined and said that it was totally okay. I'll get my rangoons next time! The food was decent and the portions are generous. Definitely a good Chinese place.\n","before I wish they have more locations here in Nevada!  I have learn to love custom build your own pizzas. I love how thin and crispy they bake their pizzas here. Really good! I just wish they have other options to their crusts (e.g. whole wheat). Overall, good place for a quick bite in MGM.\n","before I came back in yesterday to have my nail fixed. Thank you, Nick, for doing such an amazing job on it! It's beautiful. I am extremely satisfied with it. \n","\n","Management personally reached out to me and I appreciate that. Coming from the service industry business, I have learned that guest experience should always be valued because this will leave a lasting impression. When management understands that, you are certain to receive only the best of what they have to offer.  So thank you, Nailed and Lashed crew for the awesome service recovery!\n","before This place has really good curry. I ordered here yesterday thru Yelp's app called Eat24. It was awesome! So convenient. It lets you check the status of your order and gives an estimated time of pick. Also, if you order online from their website, you get 15% off and if it's thru Eat24, you get $2 off. \n","\n","The spiciness of the curry is one of the things that I like about this place. I usually get 8 when I order food at like Thai restaurants. But at this place I can only handle 5-6 spice level. It's really good and the portions are huge.\n","before This review is only for the afternoon tea service. \n","\n","I have been on a quest to find places in Las Vegas that serves afternoon tea\\/high tea. Most of the places I have tried have always been at The Strip. This is the first place I've tried that was \"off the strip\" so it doesn't come with the price. At $22\\/person + tax, the afternoon tea here was such a good deal! \n","\n","RESERVATION: One of the things you must remember is to make reservation ahead of time. When I made my reservation, they asked for my credit\\/debit card information. Also, be ready to provide the zip code associated with your card. I find a bit weird that they would ask for it. An explanation for why would have been... comforting in a way.  I do understand it's for cancellation purposes but most places just need the card number, security code and expiration date. \n","\n","TEAS: They offered several variety of teas that are in tea bags (Shangri La Tea). We tried the Chocolate Coconut and Earl Grey - both went well with the food that came along with it. I personally like the coconut tea. It has a slight hint of sweetness to it. \n","\n","FOOD: We were started off with a small plate of Buttermilk Chicken n Waffles (with honey Sriracha) with mini Godson's Mac. I personally love this because it gives you a taste of what Truffles n Bacon has to offer. I love their fried chicken and waffle! The mac and cheese was a delightful addition to the dish.\n","\n","The tea service comes with the following small bites: \n","-Assorted berry scones with apricot and raspberry jam and butter \n","- Smoked Salmon on cucumber \n","- Chicken Salad on toasted bread\n","- Tomato with chopped artichoke, cucumber and olives with yogurt filling\n","\n","Everything was delicious and delicately prepared. For the price, it was a plenty of food and endless refill of hot water for tea. \n","\n","Overall, I would say this is my favorite place for tea service so far (I am still on a hunt!). I like that it's located away from the strip and I get free parking. I love the food and I mean, who's not obsessed with their bacon jam?! I will definitely come back here for more!\n","before This place is just amazing! I went here this weekend when I was in Downtown Summerlin shopping. I was feeling a bit under the weather so I wanted a drink that has ginger in it. I tried the \"Toxin Flush\" asked for extra ginger. Man, it was the best tasting juice I've had! It was green so at first I thought it would taste bitter somehow, but when I took my first sip, I was in love! It was refreshingly good and the taste was very mild. I can drink that thing all day, every day!  \n","\n","I cannot wait to come back here and try their Acai bowls! I saw that they have different kinds here and I will have to try them all!\n","before Andrea is truly an amazing artist! Everything she touch turns into a work of art. She is personable and is very open. She exuberates so much positivity that it shows in the way she deals with her clients. It is so rare to find someone who truly loves what they do. Andrea is one of them.\n","\n","We had a clear understanding of what we expect from each other. She will do her best to understand what you need and want and she will walk you through the process before she begins. The end result did not disappoint! The results speak for themselves.\n","\n","I highly recommend to come see Andrea if you are looking for a change and is not sure what to do. Andrea will be more than helpful. Again,thank you, Andrea!\n","before I discovered this location when I was craving comfort food. I no longer live with my parents and sometimes I miss home cooked Filipino meals. It's good to still get a taste of home, away from home.  \n","\n","This little gem is located on the corner of Jones and Robindale. The inside was fairly small so it did have that \"turo turo\" feeling to it which was really comforting. I really liked the place because of that. There was a wait time which was expected in a Filipino restaurant. It was still not as bad as the wait time in DT's. Our server went from one table to another informing everyone why there was a delay or what caused the delay.  We truly appreciated their efforts in keeping their customers informed.\n","\n","When our food came, we ravished it right away. We ordered the Balikbayan Box and the Kanto Box. It used to be a lunch special they now offer it for dinner. The lechon kawali that came with my Kanto Box was really one of the best I've had. The pork was crispy on the outside but the meat remained moist and juicy. Everything that came with it was pretty decent. I also ordered the Aligue fried rice. I have not had those since I was in college in the Philippines and man, it was so good! The portion was big enough for two people but I felt like I could finish the whole thing by myself! \n","\n","Also a few things you need to know, they do not offer fountain drinks here. And, even though there's a wait service, you are expected to go up to the counter to pay after your meal. Still, I would definitely come back to get me some more of those Aligue fried rice! Writing about it now made me so hungry about it already!\n","\n","***\n","\n","Went back here last night with the whole family (There's 9 people total) and Tina personally took care of us. She was very sweet and was on top of everything. Thank you for the great service and as always, the awesome food.\n","before An expensive Asian restaurant that just happened to be in the middle of a casino - that's Grand Wok for you. \n","\n","I went here with my boyfriend for lunch on a Wednesday. The service here was excellent. Our server kept pouring us tea and I appreciate that he paid that much attention to us. Really commendable. I was just not impressed by the food. \n","\n","For appetizers, we had the chicken lettuce cups. The flavor was good and the amount of chicken was more than adequate. They even asked if we wanted more lettuce when we finished the plate and still had some chicken left. For our entrees, my boyfriend ordered three different rolls of sushi (totally forgot to take note of them) and I ordered the XO pork udon noodles. Everything tasted great just nothing impressive. It is just typical Chinese\\/Japanese food. \n","\n","Our bill ended up at around $40\\/person. For that much you can eat at any quality all-you-can eat restaurant elsewhere. I think it was just the ambience that you pay for here not exactly the food.\n","before The first time I tried this place was back in 2013. I think it was still new then and it was still separate from Bachi. \n","\n","We went here for dinner on a Sunday night. It was not too busy. I remember back then the wait time to get into Bachi is almost an hour so it was pretty surprising that we were seated right away. They brought out two menus: Bachi's and Shoku Ramen-ya's. I specifically went to this location because I wanted to try their ramen again. I remember having Tan tan men back then and I remember it being one of the best tasting ramen I've had.  \n","\n","I ordered it again last night... It changed. I don't know if the chef is different now or they just put in too much XO on the broth but it was just so salty! I could not even finish the whole thing. My boyfriend ordered the black tonkatsu. I had some and I have to admit I liked it better than the Tantamen. \n","\n","Overall, I was disappointed. I did not want to believe it when my dad told me that this place changed. So I wanted to check it out for myself. What happened to this place?\n","before This place is amazing! We went here to celebrate a friend's birthday and I've been meaning to come back again. We were seated outside and was attended to right away. \n","\n","I am not a big fan of steak but I have learned to love it after having steak here. So trust me when I say, it's really good.\n","\n","Also, order the bone marrow appetizer. You won't regret it!\n","before This restaurant has been our go to place when we want to eat out but still remain under our daily allowed calorie intake. With the healthy side available, we were still able to enjoy the taste of the happy side with just better, healthier alternatives.\n","\n","It's kind of a hit or miss here in this restaurant. One time I ordered the chicken and waffle and the chicken was so dry it turned me off to the whole dish. I tried it again the next time just to see if there would be a difference and it was cooked better than it was the first time. \n","\n","Everything I've tried on their menu so far, either on the happy or healthy side, has been satisfying and rarely ever disappointing. 4 star for the overall concept of the restaurant.\n","before I love this place! Everyone was super accommodating and funny! I went here with my friend because this place is her regular nail salon. I gave them a try and went with her this weekend. I got Dad to do my fills. He was so thorough! He really took his time with me and I appreciate his dedication to every hands he touches. I highly recommend this place especially if you live in the neighborhood. They are a sweet family and you will definitely feel at home here.\n","before **This review is based solely on one item on their menu. I will have to try their juices, and then I will update my opinion of this place. \n","\n","I went here with my boyfriend on a Sunday to grab an Acai bowl before going to the gym. We decided to try this place since my favorite place to get an Acai bowl was closed on a Sunday. Plus, this place is so close to our house we can literally walk to it.\n","\n","The location is okay. It's in the far end side of the plaza where DW Bistro is and is right next to Anytime Fitness. It is accessible and easy to find. The interior is beautifully made and well designed. It has this chic, hipster kind of vibe to it - reminds me of Portlandia. Walking in you get a whole wall designed just to show all of the juices that they offer, its benefits, and the price. I did not pay too much attention to this as I was really just here for their Acai bowl.  \n","\n","1) They only have a regular Acai bowl ($10.95) but you can add things to it like protein powder, chai seeds, etc. at an additional charge of $1.50 for each item. I just think this is pretty steep. \n","\n","2) They mixed up the orders. I chose a regular bowl and my boyfriend added protein powder to his. The guy who made the bowl specifically told him that the one with the date on it is the one with the protein powder mixed in. When I finally sat down to try my bowl, I immediately tasted the protein powder. I did not make a big deal out of this and just switched our bowls. However, just a tip, they need to be more careful next time. Some people have really strict dietary restrictions and it is one reason why they ask to have thing prepped for them in a certain way. I could have severe allergic reactions to protein powder and that could have messed me up. \n","\n","3) Their Acai bowls are TOO sweet. Do they put that much sugar in their bowls? I just hate it when something that is good for you end up not being a healthy option anymore because of all the sugar added to it. I hate to think that a place that stands for wellness is needed to be told not to put sugar on things. \n","\n","Overall, I am disappointed. You can get better tasting, better quality of ingredients used for an Acai bowl at a decent price elsewhere. I will not order here again.\n","before I have been meaning to try this place but whenever I am craving Japanese food it always seemed to be on a Sunday and Sundays they are closed. So last night, I finally got off my lazy butt and headed out to try this place.\n","\n","The inside was bigger than I thought. It was pretty spacious and there was a bar area for people dining alone. On the table is a jar of sesame seeds and a jar of katsu sauce. The server then gave us a tiny mortar and pestle that you use to grind the seeds. You can add this later on to the katsu sauce. That was an interesting experience for sure! \n","\n","So we ordered the gyoza to start. I had the Pork Curry Katsu and my boyfriend had the Chicken Katsu. Both of the katsus were delicious. They cooked it crispy on the outside while the meat remain moist. I hate dry katsu so they really hit it spot on at this place. What I think made them stood out the most from other Japanese places is their Katsu sauce. It is delicious with the perfect balance of sweet and tangy. I loved it so much that I even dipped my pork katsu more on that sauce rather than the curry sauce that it came with.\n","\n","I highly recommend this place. I love their matcha green tea too. It was perfect.\n","before Man, the service at this place is phenomenal! \n","\n","As soon as we sat down, we were asked for our drink orders and were served a complimentary chips and salsa\\/bean dip. All of that happened even before we can open the menu! It's a bunch of different servers working together. I think that's one of the things that made this place stand out for me. We have one server who took our orders but there were a bunch of other people working around making sure our drinks were filled, our dips were not running low, the used plates were out of the way, everything they were on top of it!\n","\n","The food was excellent too. I got shrimp fajita that came with a side of rice, guacamole and beans and your choice of corn or flour tortillas. I was excited to see them light it on fire! It was surely entertaining! If you order the combo on a Tuesday night, instead of paying $12, you only pay $10. The portions were huge and the sauces they provided were abundant. For two people, it was definitely a feast. We made room for desserts and ordered churros. It was sooooo good. Maybe because I have been craving them but seriously, with a little bit of whipped cream and a drizzle of chocolate syrup, those churros were melt in my mouth good. \n","\n","Also, I love it when the whole restaurant sings when it is somebody's birthday. It makes the ambiance more friendly and festive. I was definitely a good change from my boring Tuesday nights.\n","before It was my first time at Mr. Mamas. So far everything was exceptional; the service, the food and, the location. \n","\n","We went here for Sunday brunch. It is to be expected that they were packed. The guy who took my name said it will be around 25-30 minutes wait. He was awesome at what he does by the way. He kept us updated the whole time and he explained to anyone who walks in that the time is just an estimate and that it is not guaranteed. When we were finally seated, our waitress Jasmine was really nice and attentive. My coffee cup was never close to being empty. The manager would also stop by to check on us and ask us if we need anything else. This place really knows how to make their customers feel at home. \n","\n","We ordered eggs Benedict, a pancake and an order of biscuits and gravy. It was nice of Jasmine to give us a heads up about their gravy.  Their gravy is not regular gravy. It has bacon bits and maple syrup in it. It sounded interesting so we gave it a try. It was so delicious! It was creamy and rich but not too heavy. The biscuits were crispy so it blends so perfectly with the creaminess of the gravy. The pancake was not dense and had a good texture. The benny was also amazing. The eggs were seasoned well and the bacon was cooked until it is crispy but not dry\\/hard. The hash browns were to die for! It was crispy on the exterior but was still soft and moist on the insides. \n","\n","I highly recommend this place. Good food and good price.\n","before I came here for lunch today. I called and made reservations for 12:30pm. This place is usually busy at lunch. It's always a good idea to call ahead just in case especially if you're a big party. \n","\n","The service here is impeccable! The hostess showed grace under pressure.  She was taking reservations on the phone and at the same time, respectfully asking for my information. She seated us right away and our server came by to ask for our drink orders. The staffs know their menu well enough to make recommendations. I like restaurants that ensure that their people are well-trained and knowledgeable. \n","\n","I have been here for business meetings a couple of times. I always order their pizzas. My favorite one by far is the Mushroom Pizza. I changed it up a bit and went for the Prosciutto Pizza today. It is delicious! I think you can never go wrong with any of their pizzas. For appetizers, I recommend the truffle blue cheese chips. They are addicting! \n","\n","I would love to come back here and try their dinner menu. I think their excellent customer service and their wonderful drink selections are good reasons to come back.\n","before I am extremely pleased with my experience with Bite. Service was excellent and food was so delicious!\n","\n","Their pancakes are amazingly fluffy and not dense at all. I usually judge a breakfast place based on how they make their pancakes. Because seriously, if you can't make good pancakes, why even call yourself a breakfast brunch place. \n","\n","The flavors of everything we ordered were spot on! It was so good. I will definitely come back to try their other pancakes.  \n","\n","I think I may have found the new love of my life!\n","before We went here again this week for dinner. This time we opted to dine outside in the patio. We were the only ones out but our server was attentive and gave us excellent customer service as always! \n","\n","Tried different entrees this time and they were all good! I am totally in love with this place. We got a rewards card since I know we will surely be regulars here.\n","before I finally got to try the-oh-so talked about KoMex! I love the concept; I especially love Korean food so I was extremely thrilled to try this place out. \n","\n","We went here on a Saturday night around 6pm. The place was dead. It was seriously just me and my boyfriend. It was a little awkward but overall I did not mind it too much. A few tables were labeled \"Reserved\" so we were hoping that people would roll in when we were there. We stayed there for more than an hour during our meal, no sign of any other human life form except for our waitress who was super friendly by the way. \n","\n","To start, we ordered 1\\/2 Beef Bulgogi Nachos. It was delicious. The meat was so tender and it was really flavorful. The combination of the sweet sauce blended so well with the pico and jalapenos. We ordered the Bulgogi burrito next and then three tacos with three different meat: beef bulgogi, pork and chicken. All of the meats were cooked perfectly and the flavors were spot on. The burrito was made well in my opinion. You know how when they make burritos, one side has all the beans and the other side has all the meat? Here they make it so that every bite is all the combination of the meat, pico, rice, etc. It was just so good that I was able to finish the whole burrito. And trust me, it was massive! \n","\n","I will definitely come back here to get my burrito fix.\n","before I came across Cathie's profile here on Yelp. I was in desperate need of a tailor for a dress that I bought online at David's Bridal. Even though the dress fits me okay, the length was my issue. I needed the dress for a wedding in Hawaii which was then just a week away. I told her my concerns and she was more than reassuring that she'll be able to do it and do it for less than David's Bridal would. \n","\n","I just got the dress yesterday and it fits perfect. She did such an awesome job at it! I would definitely use Cathie for all my dress emergencies. Highly recommended! \n","\n","**I will post of picture of the dress after the wedding.**\n","before I've been meaning to try Pizza Rock. I learned that they opened another branch in Green Valley Ranch but I figured I must go and try the original location first. \n","\n","We went here on a weekend and the place was pretty packed. The host was attentive and seated us right away. I would describe this place as a bar kind of place rather than a restaurant. The music was loud. Trying to have a conversation it was a little bit of a challenge. \n","\n","We ordered the White Wine Clams for appetizers. It was so good! The garlicky sauce was perfect for dipping with their complimentary bread. We opted to get the classic Margherita Pizza. This too was excellent. The crust was perfectly charred which added to the great flavor of the pizza. \n","\n","I think this is one of the best go-to places in Downtown. It is worth the drive just to go try this place.\n","before This place is phenomenal. 12-courses? Heck yeah! Heed other Yelper's warning. There will be so much food. \n","\n","I made reservations for dinner here on New Year's Eve. The service is impeccable. We were constantly being check by our servers making sure everything was to our liking. \n","\n","A few changes to the menu based on the other Yelpers who tried this place before me. They included Salmon on their Teriyaki and removed the Baked and replaced it with Vegetables (Asparagus or Broccoli). \n","\n","Here are the dishes that really stood out for me (good and bad): \n","\n","1. Garlic Edemame: Way better than the regular one or the Pepperoncini. Do not think the pepperoncini will taste anything like the pickled peppers. It was just edemame with chili flakes.\n","\n","2. Super-White-Tuna \u0026 Scallop Carpaccio: These were delicious! They tasted fresh and sweet which was really a surprise to me because I personally do not like raw food but I totally made an exception with this one. \n","\n","3. Hamburger: Okay, this one is pretty weird and even our server admits it. I feel like it should not be part of the 12 course dinner. I'm guessing this is for people who do not really like sushi\\/raw fish so they can have an option. But this seriously left me dumbfounded. It is a full burger meal with fries and everything. It was not until after I finished the burger that out of curiosity, I asked if it can be changed to the other burger options (Teriyaki, Takashi, Teriyaki Tsukune, Salmon Fry Burger) and they said yes but it will be an additional charge. Good to know for future reference.\n","\n","4. Beef Sukiyaki: This was really delicious. The soup was a little sweet to my taste but the beef was so tender that I still loved the dish over all. Definitely get this over the Diced Steak. The steak was dry and the flavor was peppery so I was not really a fan of that. Plus who wants hard steak anyway?\n","\n","5. Corn and Egg Soup: I would recommend something else rather than ordering this. I was pretty disappointed with it. A little too sweet too.\n","\n","After two hours of battling against food, I am proud to say that I finished. They should really give some sort of medal\\/award to people who can actually finish. That was a lot of food! Next time I come back, no more 12-course meal. I would come back to order little bits of things that I liked. \n","\n","Thank you, Chef Takashi. That was definitely a good way to end my 2015.\n","before Finally! A donuts place right next to my house! You can only imagine my excitement.\n","\n","I was waiting for this place to open for awhile ever since they put up their sign. Today they finally have their soft opening. 50% off on all their donuts. They have unique flavors like the delicious strawberry cheesecake donut! I think its my favorite so far. Everything we had were amazing! I can't wait to try all the other ones. The staff are super friendly too. \n","\n","I recommend you check out this place and support local businesses.\n","before I've been meaning to try this place since our family live close by but it was always so packed that we did not get to try it until today. We wanted to see what the fuss is all about. \n","\n","If you go here on the weekends, expect a longer wait time. We waited for a table for around 45 minutes even though we were advised that it will only be a 20-minute wait. When we were finally seated, we were attended to right away. I liked the motif of the interior especially the spinning umbrellas on the ceilings. Our food came out right away, which was great. I ordered the corned beef hash - a classic, how can you mess that up. The flavor is better than most breakfast places that I have tried but I do not like the texture. It was chopped ham with onions and mashed potatoes (supposedly hash brown). It was a little disappointing. Everything else that we ordered were meh. Nothing really stands out. The waffle was too doughy. The orange juice tasted like it was not freshly juiced and it was a little sweet like it was mixed with concentrate (this is just my guess). \n","\n","I would still recommend this place. I might come back and give it a second opinion, maybe try their steak and eggs or their pancakes. I think since Rise and Shine is really the ONLY breakfast place in the area (I mean you can get breakfast food at The Lodge except it's a bar), a lot of people would be willing to wait for a table here. I personally think it was not worth the wait. They need to open more breakfast places in this side of town.\n","before I love everything seafood so this restaurant is one of my favorite. I've been a regular here ever since I ordered their salmon. Location - I like how it's away from the busy area of the strip - always a plus. \n","\n","For the love of all things good and holy, try the Wood-Grilled Atlantic Salmon with just the lemon butter sauce! It's just so simple but it's always spot on. In this case, less is more. I've had their spring special with the salmon dynamite style, I did not like it as much. I think the flavor was overwhelming that it overpowered the fish. \n","\n","The service here is consistently excellent and the food is always fresh. \n","\n","I highly recommend this place.\n","before I went to this place after lunch on a Sunday. It was empty. \n","\n","One thing you need to know, this place has A LOT (2 glass cases) of flavors that they offer but they limit you to only two taste samples per customer. The owners were not as friendly as I hoped. We came in and they did not welcome us. They kept asking what we want and it was really hard to decide with only two samples and all the selections that they have. I felt like I had to make a decision right away. There are no other customers but me and three of my friends. I really did not understand what the rush was about.  \n","\n","On a lighter note, the gelato made up for what they lack in guest relations. It was pretty good. Just the usual traditional flavors you might expect nothing experimental or unusual unlike Gelatology.\n","before I came from a tropical country so I am still not used to the cold. So on days like these, I usually just crave anything hot or spicy to warm me up. What better way to do it than getting some Schezuan noodles into my belly!\n","\n","**The moment I walked in, the smell of chlorine from the floor cleaner greeted me with a punch. The place is small so the smell lingered for a while. Also, I noticed that the floor was still a little wet and there was no wet floor sign anywhere. Tip to the business owner: Place a sign when you do this or have someone watch the floor to warn people. This is how you can get sued. **\n","\n","It was a little busy when we went in so it took sometime before someone was able to seat us. We sat at the bar area with a full view of the kitchen. Some people are more sensitive than I am and I understand that. I will let you judge how they cook in the kitchen. I am just here for the finished product. \n","\n","Chicken Steamed Dumplings - We ordered these for appetizer. 10 pieces for $6, not too bad. I liked the flavor of the dumplings and goes well with our soup. Next time I will order it as pan fried\\/fried. \n","\n","Shanxi Knife Sliced Noodle Soup - This soup was delicious. It has a mild sweet taste to it reminds me of braised beef. This is basically that with thin flat noodles. The beef brisket was so good. It was soft and flavorful. The only problem with this dish was it was a little harder to eat because the noodles are flat and short. I had a hard time picking it up with my chopsticks. Aside from that, this one was a good choice.\n","\n","Hot and Spicy Noodle Soup - When they say spicy, they really mean spicy! But even though you get the numbing sensation of the spice, you still get a lot of flavor from the dish. The ground pork that was mixed in with the soup reminds me of an XO paste but instead of seafood, it was made with pork. It was a little salty so I did not drink most of the broth. There was a lot of oil in the broth which I believe was chili oil - that made it even harder to slurp. I would definitely order this again. \n","\n","The prices are very reasonable and the portions are big. Definitely a good reason to come back. I am hopeful that they will broaden their menu and offer more selections in the future.\n","before Heed everyone's warning: The service here is TERRIBLE. But you get what you pay for, right? For $16\\/person + tax and tip, this is one of the cheaper places to go to if you want AYCE KBBQ. \n","\n","I have been to Korean Garden a couple of times with my friends. My experiences with them were pretty pleasant so I decided to take my family here. Worst decision ever. \n","\n","Given the fact that the service here is already terrible, the staffs are not one bit nice about it at all. Here's what really ticked me off:\n","\n"," 1) They bring the meat to the table but they take forever to come back to put it on the grill. (Trust me, I would love to do the cooking myself but I got called out before for touching the tongs\\/scissors). They need an excuse for that gratuity.\n","\n","2) They automatically get gratuity because it's their house rule. I get it that they cook the food\\/cut the meats on the grill but most of the time they are not around to do it anyway. They probably know that if they leave it to the customers to tip they would get 0 tip because of how bad their service is. \n","\n","3) The time limit of 1 hour and 30 minutes is not enough because I spent 45+ minutes of that time, waiting. I was not able to enjoy my meal because they were so slow that I practically just waited all that time. Waiting for the meat, waiting for the drinks, waiting for the bill, etc. \n","\n","I probably would not be back anymore. I would rather shell out a few more dollars in a nicer spot where they actually care for their customers rather than be given mediocre food and bad service. My suggestion would be, go here off peak hours - maybe the service would be better.\n","before I have been meaning to try this place for so long. I have heard a lot of good things about BabyStacks (especially that they have Filipino\\/Hawaiian dish for breakfast) but they are always busy. The few times I tried going, the wait was over an hour. \n","\n","So Saturday morning, I woke up at 7am and made my way to an awesome breakfast. If there is something worth waking up to early on a Saturday morning, it's BabyStacks. \n","\n","Let me just say, they have the best red velvet pancake I have ever had. I am not super sold on Red Velvet altogether but I fell in love with their pancakes. It was moist and delicious. It was just pure perfection. I also ordered the famous Lolo Rick's Adobo fried rice with a side of Portuguese sausages. It was good but I thought the adobo would taste like the adobo I used to eat growing up. I guess I set myself up for my own disappointment. I still liked it and I think it is worth the try. \n","\n","I would definitely be coming back to BabyStacks. I might even give the place right next to them a try if the next time they are packed. I saw that they the offer traditional Filipino breakfast, so excited for that. I can't wait to come back!\n","before Good food and good service! The owners were very nice. It is owned by a couple who were from Hawaii, very nice people. The cook everything fresh as you order. The portions are huge! Definitely one of my favorite Hawaiian places!\n","before I just love their pancakes here! \n","\n","The service here is usually good. We've been coming here every weekend for breakfast and the staff knows us already. But there are times that we will be seated with servers who are not as attentive. \n","\n","But the food is always good. No complaint so far.\n","before After passing by a few times, I finally took the time to check this place out and I must say I'm so glad I did. It is located in the same weird area as Braddah's on Warms Springs and Tenaya. It is LITERALLY a hidden gem. \n","\n","Angus Beef Gyoza: This is one great tasting dish! The beef was really flavorful that every bite made me went, \"Hmmm.\" It is easy to overcook beef specially if you try to fry it but the chef cooked it so perfectly. My only concern was since the beef was a little fatty, it was a little bit oily\\/greasy. Still it was very good.\n","\n","Rock Shrimp: We ordered this as an appetizer. It reminded me of the \"Bang Bang\" shrimp from Bonefish but instead of the sweet spicy sauce, it was in a Yuzu sauce that was tangy and spicy. Delicious! I fell in love with every bite. \n","\n","Chilean Sea Bass: This dish was listed under the Chef's Specialty part of the menu. It came with a cilantro sauce that paired perfectly with the fish. It was pan-fried to perfection giving it that crispy bite. Highly recommended. \n","\n","Scottish Salmon: This dish was also from the Chef's Specialty menu. The salmon was pan-fried to your preference. I always get mine medium\\/medium well. Like a perfect steak, do not get your fish well done. It really is a waste. The flavor was spot on good. It tasted like teriyaki with a hint of yuzu. It came with a house salad and the sauce they used for that you can dip your fish in to give it that extra ump. \n","\n","Yuzu Coconut Mochi with Genmai Cha Ice Cream: What better way to end a perfect dinner but with a perfect dessert. The mochi was the best one I've tasted so far. It is not frozen so it was soft and chewy. The ice cream totally hit the spot for me. I love Genmai Cha as a tea but for it to an ice cream flavor, it was heaven on earth. \n","\n","The chef's cooking skills are phenomenal. Every dish that came out that that kitchen was a work of art. Next time I come here, I will try and catch their happy hour. I heard a lot of good things about it. A good way to sample a lot of the items on their menu.\n","before I was craving a burrito bowl after a workout so instead of going to my usual stop, which was Chipotle, I opted to try Braddah's.  I love Hawaiian food so why not.\n","\n","At 7pm on a regular Monday night, this place was just deserted. I think it was the location. There is only one other restaurant there in that plaza which was a Japanese place and even they do not look like there were getting a lot of business too. \n","\n","We walked in and were greeted warmly by everyone in store. They asked if it was our first time there and we said \"Yes.\" They gave us a sample of each of their meats and recommended which sauce goes well with what. So we got two things: Huli Huli Chicken bowl with brown rice and a Pulehu Steak Burrito with the seaweed rice. \n","\n","Flavor wise, I loved it! Only concern - The food was actually pretty cold even though they prepared it in front of us. Maybe the meat was left out for too long? Given that they do not get as much business, the meat was a tad bit cold so I was disappointed about that. This has a potential to be really good but it just did not have that served hot and fresh factor that should come in all sit down places anyway. Even Subway offers to heat up your food, right? I do have to remember, however, that it is a fast food place.\n","\n","So overall, I'd say meh. I would still give it three stars because of how nice the staffs were.  They even gave us free coconut bark for desserts.\n","before I am so thankful I found this place! As a BMW owner, my biggest fear was getting work done on my car. I dreaded the times I have to go to the \"stealership\". They overcharge for everything! Never again shall I be fooled by them! \n","\n","All thanks to Victor for being accommodating of my needs. I was super worried about my car but he reassured me that he will take care of it and that he'll make sure to get me out of there in no time. They do honest repairs for you and only charge for a reasonable amount. These guys really know their stuff. \n","\n","I highly recommend this place to all BMW owners.\n","before If you go here for Sunday brunch, expect the wait to be more than an hour. Personally, I think the wait was worth it. Most of the food here tastes great. The servings are HUGE! I think one plate of anything you order is a good amount that can be shared by three people. It's that crazy big! I love their crispy potatoes! The bacon waffle, a must try! Everything here is a heart attack on a plate. But they are all so good. \n","\n","We attended Flavors of the Heart last Saturday and they were there sampling their crab cakes. I just want to commend their chef because it was good and it was one of my favorites! \n","\n","Love what you do for the AHA!\n","before I took our family here for my boyfriend's birthday celebration which was a Sunday night. There were 11 of us in our group and only 5 of us opted for the AYCE while the others just ordered from the a la carte menu. So imagine how crazy that can get. I love my family but to be honest, they can be a bit difficult sometimes. The staff handled everyone's orders so well. Even though the restaurant was packed everyone in our group felt well taken care of by the staff. \n","\n","To top it all of, everyone love their sushi. No complaint here on our end. Thank you, Jjanga family for taking care of us last night and kudos to everyone!\n","before As a new addition to our growing part of town, I welcome this place with open arms! \n","\n","I love breakfast food so I definitely approved of this place. It was little bit tricky to find if you do not look them up ahead of time. The place is gorgeous inside. I love the big windows letting natural light in. The staff and the owner were all super nice and accommodating. They checked up on us so many times and even suggested specials that we can try for next time. They even gave us coupons for half price off our next visit!\n","\n","Their specialties are pancakes but they have traditional breakfast food and sandwiches that they offer. I tried the Monkey Business because it reminded me of Chunky Monkey! It has good flavors and I really like bananas with peanut butter anyway so that is definitely a good one. \n","\n","Overall, it was a pleasant experience. I will definitely come back and try their other pancakes!\n","before This place is crazy GOOD but I'm giving it a four star because of the BAD service. \n","\n","We went here for dinner last night for a friend's birthday. It was a Tuesday night and it was not busy at all. We made reservations at 7:15 PM and stayed until the restaurant closed at 10PM. Our server was always missing in action. We were not served desserts until around 9:40 PM. What annoyed me more was when we were in the middle of eating our desserts, she went around to drop off the check. It felt like she was hurrying us up. Well if she was more attentive, we could have finished earlier than we did.\n","\n","On the lighter note, the food was excellent. Everything was on point! It's really just the service that got to me. The servers need to be more attentive and aware of their guests. \n","\n","So if you want good food and you have a lot of time to kill for dinner, you must go try this place.\n","before This place is so good! The service is excellent. The moment you walk in their store they immediately make you feel so at home. They are so attentive! I love love this place so much! \n","\n","It's awesome how they always have different flavors everyday. My favorite by far is the Green Tea Kit-Kat! \n","\n","Amazing!\n","before Stopped by here again for breakfast-to-go. \n","\n","FYI, they do not serve food other than their bowls and juices until 11AM.\n","before We went here for dinner last night. I have been a fan of custom made pizzas and I had pretty good experiences with similar places (Pielogy, Project Pie). \n","\n","Their menu has a vast variety of options. You can choose from regular crust to whole wheat or gluten-free. You can either choose to build-your-own pizzas or you can choose from their special menu that offers ingredients that are not made available for the build your own. They had interesting choices like clams, goat cheese, Hawaiian, etc. \n","\n","I went for one of their specials: the Fig \u0026 Prosciutto with goat cheese, arugula on whole wheat while my boyfriend had his custom built. Both pizzas tasted amazing! The fig preserve on my pizza was sweet and tangy but it was perfectly balanced out by the saltiness of the cheese and meat. Also, since I did not have much sauce on mine, the crust came out super crispy! The custom pizza had a lot of ingredients in it so the crust was not as crisp but still the flavor was excellent. I guess in cases of thin crust pizzas, less is more. \n","\n","I would definitely recommend this place. If you're in the mood for custom made pizzas but don't want to drive to the strip or Summerlin, you have to try it out. Plus, Halloween City just opened up right next to them.\n","before I've always wanted to try Pinches Tacos but their Las Vegas location was in Downtown. As a local, I try to avoid going to the strip or the old strip for that matter because of traffic. So imagine my excitement when I learned that they opened a new location in Spring Valley! \n","\n","My boyfriend and I went here for dinner last night (Wednesday). We were immediately greeted by who we later on learned as \"Javier\", one of the Anaya brothers - creator of the awesome Gringos Tacos. He gave us a couple of suggestions from their menu so we decided to get the combo to be able to try almost most of it: Gringos, AlPastor, Asada, Shrimp and Fish Tacos. Everything tasted wonderful! It was so delicious we told everyone we know that they must try this place. \n","\n","However their grand opening might not be until mid-November (or so we're told), so if you do decide to swing by, just remember to BYOB. Overall, this place has impressive food and it's always a plus when you are treated like family. This will definitely keep us coming back for more!\n","before First of all, I am really excited that there is finally a ramen place here in the Southwest! So when we saw that this place opened, we tried it right away. \n","\n","I learned that \"omoide\" means \"memories, recollections\" in Japanese which is reflected well within the interior of this ramen place. The design reminds me of a street in Japan where you find a random ramen spot and discover that it's a diamond in the rough. It is very well-lit (love the paper lanterns!) and spacious. I like that the windows are big letting more light into the place. Most ramen places make it so that their interiors are dark.  It makes me feel a little claustrophobic sometimes. The ambiance inside Omoide is homey and comforting. \n","\n","The food here is decent. Not the best. It is hard not to compare it to Monta Choya. Their broth for their ramen is pretty bland. I think that is a good thing. It is refreshing to have a ramen place where you can control how salty you want your broth to be.  The portions are big so you get your money's worth. \n","\n","Overall, this is still a pretty good ramen place. They are new so there is always room for improvement.\n","before This is one of my favorite breakfast places! \n","\n","One reason why I love this place is their waffles. It's light and fluffy and they make it so perfectly that it's crispy on the sides but it stays moist and soft in the middle. I usually order it with strawberries, banana or blueberries on top. For me, it's the best waffle in comparison to other breakfast places. I also like their skillets here best. You can never go wrong with any skillet you choose. They always serve it smoking hot just the way I like it. I've never had bad service here.\n","\n","Overall, this place is awesome.\n","before I love this place because of their awesome crew! Shout out to Blake and Steven for always being so friendly and accommodating! \n","\n","I have never been to the other locations before but I have grown to love this one since it is closer to where I live now. It is also not too far from Planet Fitness on Rainbow and 215 so this is definitely my favorite go to place for my post-workout meals. I've been to this location four times already and the food is fresh and delicious every time. \n","\n","They offer a wide selection of meals, protein shakes and smoothies. If you are watching your calorie intake, this place is great. They have low calorie pizzas and burgers!  I will definitely recommend this place if you are looking for delicious and healthy food.\n","before I discovered Buldogis from one of the Las Vegas Foodie Festival that I attended a few years back. I fell in love with them right away. I have tried other hotdog trucks before but Buldogis have my heart because of their Asian\\/Hawaiian twists to it. \n","\n","We were in their Sahara location so we gave them a try. They offer a lot of other food on their menu now including the Hangover Soup. I might come back sooner just to try one of their burgers too. Three things that we ordered: \n","\n","#1 - Bulgogi Hotdog    3.5\\/5\n","#2 - Ban Mi Hotdog       5\\/5\n","#3 - Hawaiian Hotdog  5\\/5\n","\n","I liked all of the things that we ordered. I personally loved the Hawaiian dog. It came with a pineapple salsa which was tangy which blended so perfectly with the saltiness of the hotdog. The crispy pork belly was a plus. I love me some fatty pork! \n","\n","I will definitely come back to try other items in their menu. Especially the burgers, they all sounded so interesting!\n","before We went here for dinner on a Wednesday night. The place was empty aside from us and one other couple. Also, this place does not offer all you can eat sushi. This was a plus for me since I always think that the quality of the food is better in most cases. \n","\n","Spicy Bacon Tempura: This is one unique dish. I had bacon rolls before but not bacon tempura. What can I say? I love bacon and its flavor. I just did not like the oiliness of the dish. The bacon was fatty (I am not complaining!) and so frying it and putting batter around it made it a little too oily in my opinion. However, the sweet sauce that came with it balanced it out. I love anything sweet and salty.\n","\n","Salmon Poke Tacos: The fish was fresh and the flavors were spot on. The fusion of the crunchy taco mixed with the mild Asian zing of the fish blend so well together. \n","\n","Salmon Rolls\\/Spicy Spider Rolls: The rolls that we tried all had wonderful flavors in it. The spider roll was just a regular spider roll. They were more than accommodating when I requested for it to be spicy. The rolls were fresh and the flavors were one of the best I've had. \n","\n","Grilled Salmon Bowl: One of my favorites yet! I love salmon and if you can cook salmon perfectly, I'm always sold on your establishment. The flavors were simple and yet extremely satisfying. The salmon was served with white rice and a side of sautéed mushroom and vegetables. It was cooked in a sweet sauce that blends well with the saltiness of the fish. One of the best salmon I had! I just inhaled that thing like crazy. The portion was a good amount. But because it was so good, it kept me wanting more.\n","\n","What a wonderful find! This place is located near Skinnyfats on Durango. I've passed by this place so many times without realizing it. I highly recommend that you check out this place.\n","before I keep coming back here for their Wintermelon milk tea! It's just the bomb. You can either order it hot or cold. WIth the weather recently, a hot milk tea was just a perfect way to end the day.\n","\n","I always order my tea with 25% sugar level but it always turns out to be really sweet (I can only imagine the 100%). I might try ordering with 0% next time and see how that turns out.  \n","\n","The food here is pretty okay. I cannot totally speak for it altogether. I have not tried enough of their \"fusion\" food to judge it. We always ordered take out too. Even though, I believe that the quality of food should not suffer whether it be dine in or take outs - sometimes it just can't be helped. I will try eating there when I find the time.\n","\n","I do love their Pork Belly Moco. It's very unique and very tasty. A little fatty but I sure that's what makes the dish taste that good. The chicken katsu is good too and so is their Pork Lau Lau and Kahlua Pork. I love Hawaiian food so I can be pretty bias. \n","\n","I will definitely be back.\n","before This place is such a great find! We were invited here for dinner last night by some friends. We were warned that this place has pure vegetarian menu. I love trying new food so I was all for it. I came in there with an open mind.  And to be honest, this place blew me away!\n","\n","Lemon Chicken \\/ Kung Pao Chicken- I could not even tell the difference. The meat felt and tasted just like chicken to me.  \n","\n","House Fried Rice - This one is really one of the best things on their menu. It has ham, chicken and shrimp. He really got the texture and the flavors of the meats down. The way he made the shrimp, it looked and tasted like real shrimp. I have to constantly remind myself that all of these are made with vegetables. Maybe my mind was playing tricks on me!\n","\n","Crispy Eggplant - By far, this one is my favorite! It was cooked in vegetarian oyster sauce. The flavor was so good! I love how it was cooked crispy on the outside and yet soft in the middle. This dish made me change my opinion of eggplants. \n","\n","Salt and Pepper Veggie Rib Strips - Like everything else that we tried, this one really felt like real meat in my mouth. It was a little tough but I guess most salt and pepper dishes are made that way. Or at least the ones I've had were always cooked a little dry. It's not really a savory dish but it was still a pretty good choice. \n","\n","I love how Chef Kenny was able to do all these things. I give this place five star for innovation. Even if you are disappointed with some things, the flavors are still spot on. I know that most vegan dishes are made out of tofu. And you know tofu given its texture, you cannot really do much with it. The way Chef Kenny made it possible for vegans to still be able to enjoy the taste of meat is such an amazing work of art. Science and art and some kind of magic! I am totally amazed.\n","before I went here for a nail emergency (meaning: I bit off almost all of my acrylic nails again, do not ask me how I did it). To all my nail biting ladies out there, do not do it! Getting acrylic nails off of your fingernails was torturous. Trust me, I already did the leg work. \n","\n","I called the salon and did not ask for anyone in particular. I was surprised that I got an appointment with James. I learned from Yelp that James is one of the best if not the best. I was so excited to meet him. He welcomed me and was super accommodating and understanding. He tried his best to not make the process hurt me too much - which I greatly appreciate. He is an expert at what he does and it is apparent in the way he handles his client. \n","\n","I highly recommend this establishment. They charged fairly for high quality work. I've been to other nail salons that are expensive but just could not deliver the way this place did.\n","before This location was crazy busy. I think one reason is that Sunset Station is more accessible to locals. When it was in Rio, it was not as bad as this. The food was okay, there were fewer trucks than when it was at the Linq (or at least the ones that I like most). \n","\n","I do not like the fact that the rides\\/carnival part was literally right next to the trucks. It was so cramped. There were fewer places to sit so even if I wanted to try a lot of other food trucks, it was always a dilemma to try and find a spot. If you're with a group of people it's even harder. I mean, I do not mind just standing on the sides while eating my food. But with this much crowd, even standing anyway was not a fun thing. \n","\n","The foodie fest is always an event I look forward to. The location could have been better though.\n","before My one star review is purely on customer service. The rooms were clean, and comfortable. They do try to deceive you online with their sister resort that has all the amazing amentities, which has the same name but located at the bottom of the strip. Now let's get back to it. Check in is not until 4pm, but they guaranteed a spot by 1pm if we early check in. Not only did we have to wait till 4pm, but they kept telling us in 30min, in a hour Oh not much longer. It took them 3 hours not to clean the room, but to inspect it?? Even if it does take that long check out is horrible as well. I had a late flight and asked to stay in a little later (checkout is 10am!) Which I figured shouldn't be an issue since check in isn't till 4pm. They said you can extend till 1pm for an extra cost, or stay an extra hour as a courtesy. They called me back an hour later to tell me management said I cannot do either. I apologize for the long review but when you and your wife are about to get married and you asked for an early room to prepare and they say yes and then drag you on until 4pm is a bit stressful\n","before The best around, Audra basically stopped what she was doing to create a beautiful bouquet for my mother in laws wedding in less than an hour for a great price too.\n","before Very HAPPY customer... the flower we ordered were so PRETTY colorful.... the workers were very helpful and kind. I'm very happy wit the service provided. \n","Thank you.\n","before This place is simply incredible. We've dined in as well as received catering from them and our guests were blown away. Incredible food and a great atmosphere and BYOB. Seriously top notch\n","before Delicious pierogies and great fried Atlantic Cod. Seriously it was buttery and flaky and perfect. The only thing that doesn't give this review five stars is that my husband got the gumbo and it didn't have crawfish or okra. The spices were pretty dead on but if you're going to make gumbo, and we respect the seafood limitations of the region, you need to at least have okra. Also, if you're going to charge $23 for gumbo it really should have crawfish. Other than that the service was great and the onion rings are phenomenal. Beer selection is superb and I didn't need more than one Moscow mule before I was feeling it. I will definitely come back.\n","before I've come here a total of 2 times and both times I don't remember leaving. Awesome dark little bar where people do their thing and don't notice anyone else. So great for that. The food...not so great but when you're trashed you just want to eat everything.\n","before So the sushi is by far superior compared to the options in the area. My fiancé and I have gone twice now and we've been really happy with our sushi both times. AND it's BYOB so you save a lot bringing your own wine or what have you. The only negatives (hence the 3 stars) is that the service is crazyyyy slow and the atmosphere is very awkward. To the point where we've really wanted sushi and wanted Fuji but chosen elsewhere because we want to have fun and enjoy each other's company, too. The first time we went there was one other couple and no music or anything in a brightly lit dining area. The problem=you don't want to talk at all. You feel as though you have to whisper and it's just really uncomfortable. The second time we went it was the same stuff just with more people dining. They really have something going right here with the food, but just putting on some music and getting an extra server would greatly improve the dining experience. Also, you can order food to-go (which we attempted to do for our first dining experience) but they won't tell you what's in a roll on the phone when ordering because people 'steal' his recipes. He will tell you to come in and look at the menu then order which defeats the purpose of ordering carry out. Again, awesome food just flawed in execution.\n","before As sushi goes-very good. We had five rolls- Spicy Tuna, Rock and Roll, Yellow Tail, First Date, and the Dragon Roll. They were all delicious. The ambiance was pretty good and the service wasn't too bad-a little slow to start out with. The ginger salad was just odd. My husband and I couldn't quite put our finger on it but it was just odd. The miso soup didn't have any seaweed in it at all. I'm not saying it was understated, I'm saying there was absolutely nothing green in there and it was very salty. \n","\n","Since we went there for sushi and the sushi was great we can't really complain.\n","before I went to Emporio a couple weeks ago and it was exceptional. Extremely simple food done well. I had the poutine with tater tots, bacon, cheese, and mushroom gravy as well as a wedge salad, olives, and Parmesan fries.  Everything was delicious but the fries were supposed to have vinegar on them and I didn't taste it at all. Nice ambience, but extremely loud and the service was incredibly slow. I'm looking forward to checking out the rooftop bar next time!\n","before Definitely amazing. A little on the greasy size, but you have to expect that with meals largely made of meat. The grilled vegetales and entragña were INCREDIBLE! Seriously, best skirt steak I've ever had. The owner is really cool and does the rounds of the (tiny) restaurant. They're expanding into the space next door eventually. Also, it's BYOB so don't forget to bring your booze.\n","before We love the hood!  We go there often and have always had a great time. Parking blows but it is what it is. The wings are awesome and we love their kettle cooked chips with French onion dip. Beers are ice cold and the staff is friendly and remembers your orders when you come back. Gets packed on weekends and during games but food is always great as is service.\n","before I've been going to this location for about a year and they have always treated me very well and been extremely accommodating to my schedule and needs.  Greg is super helpful and remembers everything about his customers and their cars.  He's gone above and beyond to help me figure out the technology in my car and make tire repairs as cheap as possible (knowing I'm a broke grad student).  Also, A+ on letting me know my insurance and registration were about a day from expiring...definitely didn't even cross my mind!\n","before If you're looking for straight-forward good Thai food then Thai Cuisine is the place to go. No frills, BYOB, no spa-like music simple Thai. It was quite good-I can't say it was an over the moon astounding, mind blowing, life changing experience, but it was good and what you want when you go for Thai food. \n","\n","My husband had the spicy duck and it had good flavor, although more of a 5 than 7 on a 1-10 spicy scale. Really good. \n","\n","I had spicy noodles chillin' at my standard 7 on the 1-10 scale. I can't complain. The noodles were great and the vegetables were deliciously cooked (I tend to go vegetarian). \n","\n","I will say the dumplings and spring rolls we had as appetizers were a notch above what we've had elsewhere in Pitt. \n","\n","We will definitely go back!\n","before Okay, for every negative there is a positive with this place. And I put the 'positive' part after 'negative' because it's really not BAD at all. In any sense of the word. \n","\n","I'm always a fan of BYOB places...so there's that.\n","\n","The place is small but the service is very quick and eager (perhaps too much...she checked on us way too much and there was a definite feeling of her trying really hard to come across as super friendly and nice. It kind of felt like she was part of our conversations). It has a friendly atmosphere and a comfortable vibe to it.\n","\n","My boyfriend got the pork chops which I'm never a fan of but it was well prepared and the cabbage\\/mashed potato bed it was on was delicious. Reminded me of a German eisbein.\n","\n","I got the beet and bleu cheese salad and it was delicious.  Wayyyyyyy too many beets but I love a little beet dish by itself so I'm really not complaining. Really, it's a great salad. I also got the mussel appetizer and they were the biggest mussels I've ever seen. The only negative is that they were extremely gritty and I felt way too many times like I was crunching on sand and I couldn't finish as it was turning my stomach.\n","\n","Side note: they have an interesting dip for their bread...a white bean puree in balsamic vinegar and oil. It would have been better had they 86ed the white bean puree. Just really an addition without adding anything.\n","before I really do love this place. The food is heathy and delicious and the servers (especially Tony) make it fun and a great experience. The best thing I've had is the tuna tartare something or whatever (just ask them and they can tell you). SO much flavor. It's delicious.\n","before Do absolutely everything you can to live anywhere else but here. It's a racket where they lock you in requiring a 60-day notice to cancel BUT NOT FROM THE DATE YOU CANCEL. It's to the next month so they're basically sucking you in for 3 months rent then charge you a month termination fee (because they never show you the models on the floors you'll deal with and the terrible conditions you deal with). It's 30 days anywhere else. Just a short list of the problems:\n","\n","-There are people that literally just squat in other peoples' apartments (I'm talking at least 12 to an apartment) who come and go and slam the doors all day and night.\n","\n","-You can't take the stairs instead of the elevators and there aren't enough elevators to accommodate the demand, so you'll be stuck standing and waiting to get anywhere for a very long time.\n","\n","-Whatever people are cooking (and smoking) in their apartments permeates the air in the hall and gets into your apartment.\n","\n","-If it's not the road construction that wakes you up and serves as your background noise, it's the work going on in the building at any given moment\n","\n","-A lot of the doormen are just incredibly rude\n","\n","-Prepare to get really uncomfortable as the multitude of ethnicities gawk and stare at you while they carry potent-smelling foods to various floors on the elevators...barefoot.\n","\n","-If you have a dog, also prepare to have other people make you wait for another elevator because they're scared (including maintenance staff).\n","\n","-The trash chute also permeates the hall with its distinctive smell of rotting strawberries, all the time\n","\n","-Really bad insulation on the windows\n","\n","-The 2 leasing agents gave me a hard time for ACTUALLY reading my lease when I said and told me they would send a copy. It's been 6 months and they still haven't and I'm still waiting on a copy after my 3rd request.\n","\n","-Don't expect anyone to get back to you with an expediency\n","\n","-It's an overpriced geriatric facility and\\/or dormitory. It can be quite confusing.\n","\n","-The only option for guest parking is an expensive valet option or metered parking on the side streets (where my boyfriend's car got vandalized and broken into b\\/c you are in the Hill District).\n","\n","-HILL DISTRICT + NEXT TO CONSOL =really awkward encounters outside and either not coming home during an event at Consol or being a hermit and not leaving.\n","\n","-Alarms, sirens, and yelling drunk people all night\n","\n","-AC cuts off on Oct. 1 so you'll get hot boxed in your, as aforementioned, poorly insulated apartment\n","\n","This is a short list. I will certainly add to it as more irritations arise.\n","\n","You'd be better off living anywhere but here for any length of time.\n","before Food is pretty good and there really aren't many options in the area but it's not a good value. If you drink beer\\/alcohol it's not affordable. The beers are overpriced and the place is musty, dark, and dingy.\n","before There are things I love about Butcher...but that upstairs bartender is truly an ass.  I've dealt with him on 3 separate occasions where he was just blatantly rude to a degree I have never experienced in the service industry.  Openly mocking me and treating me so terribly that my date told him flat out he's being a dick.  He was nice to my date for the rest of the evening but not me.  We were going to stay for the rest of the night b\\/c we love the cocktails there but he absolutely ruined our moods so we left and went elsewhere.  I ended up paying for the meal so his being nice to my date was fruitless for him because, for the first time in my life, I gave well below my standard 30% tip.  \n","\n","I normally would not have gone on this rant publicly and figured that, perhaps, he just remembered me those three times and I 'rubbed him the wrong way', but just yesterday my friend told me about a nearly identical experience she had with him.  I spoke to another friend of mine and the, \"oh, the asshole Asian guy?!\" response says this is just his method of operation.  He deters us from wanting to return.  If he hates serving people drinks so much he should seek employment in another field.\n","before This place is pretty great. Cool atmosphere and HUGE. We ordered 3 appetizers: spinach and artichoke dip, chicken lettuce wraps, and the mussels. The dip was incredible and not runny and oily like it can be at a lot of places. The lettuce wraps were good and had a lot of flavor but the portion size was dinky to the extreme. Like a tiny little condiment bowl of chicken. The mussels had good flavor but were cooked too long. \n","\n","I then got the seven onion soup bowl and it was AMAZING and my boyfriend and I shared a pizza-the mushroom and pesto one. The pizza was so good and perfectly cooked. \n","\n","We each had several beers-mostly Oktoberfest and their IPA. Several so they were obviously worthy of multiples. \n","\n","Next time I'd really like to check out the outdoor area-it looks really beautiful.\n","before Absolutely the best tacos I have ever had. Very quick service and the people are very nice. A ton of options and very spicy. There was a bit of a language barrier, but you can pay for the tacos inside if you only have a card and outside in cash. I had the potato taco and I went back for a second that night. The tortillas are soft and handmade and the toppings are fresh. Seriously, go there. $2 a taco cannot be beat for this quality of product.\n","before We've checked out this place three times because we really wanted to make it our neighborhood spot because we live really close, but it fell short all three times. The first time we went we waited 45 minutes to get a server's attention. It was during a Pens game so we made allowances but the food really wasn't very good.  Second time, the service was better but they don't have Bud Light on tap and we really don't like Coors or Miller and especially not Labatt. The bottles we ordered were warmish.  Third time we went we gave up and agreed on the way out that we gave it a good shot but the convenience is just not worth the food. If we go back it will only be to drink.\n","before Don't order the 'steak' salad. It's not steak. I'm told it's 'steakums'??? I'm unfamiliar. It wasn't great.\n","\n","Anywho...pizza is fine but and mozzarella sticks are deep fried in a weird way I wish I could describe. \n","\n","They're friendly and we'll likely use them again but kinda sad.\n","before I've come here with my boyfriend twice now and both times the food and atmosphere have been wonderful. Last time we had the Funghi pizza and last night we had the Sopressatta pizza. The Funghi was definitely our favorite. The crust isn't too crispy like with a lot of brick oven pizzas-just the right amount of chewy and crispy. The BLT salad is delicious, although the roasted tomatoes were a little too roasted for me last night. They loved their candied bacon...we thought it was okay-a little too sweet for us. They have awesome beer choices and the bartender is honest about what's good and legitimately wants you to have a good time. I think we will make this a regular spot for us!\n","before My husband and I went here for the first time today and it was delicious! I had two veggie dogs: the Louisiana Ave. and Bruschetta dogs. The Louisiana Ave had hot sauce and Cajun cole slaw and it was really hot. Definitely didn't skimp on portions and delicious. Ingredients were fresh and the pesto on the bruschetta dog was delicious and creamy. I also had a vegetarian sloppy joe and that was eh but we were really there for the dogs. Definitely go and give it a try. The guy there was super nice, too.\n","before My girlfriends and I love this place. The food is good (especially the shishito peppers) and they have a great wine list. It's a bit pricey which is the main drawback for me and the atmosphere is kinda uptight from being on top of each other. The food is great and it's a great time but not worth the price.\n","before Great food and diner atmosphere. Well worth the wait if you come in on the weekend. Everything is fresh and made from scratch. We will be becoming a regular at this place for sure\n","before I'm staying at Caesar's Palace for 4th of July weekend and today was my very first time visiting the long anticipated Bacchanal Buffet. I have to admit, with all the hype and 5 star positive reviews I have heard of this buffet (from friends, peers and other reviews) there was a heck of a lot to live up to. The result? Two thumbs up of approval. Absolutely AMAZING.\n","Upon entrance, I was blown away by the decor. Stunning. The restaurant utilizes glassware for much of their decor, which made for contemporary, yet comfortable ambiance, garnished with an array of the most appetizing dishes I have ever seen at a buffet - and I have been to many around the USA, especially buffets in Las Vegas.\n","I sampled everything. Starting with the Chinese food to the Mexican Sope (stuffed with zucchini flower and cheese) these were incredible - I could have eaten THREE. Next was the Wagyu Beef, Brisket, and the Suckling Pig - not fatty, full of meat, skin was cripsy - perfectly done and the chef on the meat station was a hoot! Ended the meal with an awesome selection of desserts. The dessert station - my favorite - where do I even begin? (salivate salivate) Most of the buffets in Vegas I've eaten at are overly sweet and taste like they've come out of a box. The desserts here are spot on. Gelato and Ice Cream selection is excellent. Some of the best ice creams I have ever tasted - lemon basil sorbet- heart heart. Rice pudding was refreshing and tart. The coconut macroons, Good Lord. For the holiday weekend they even decorated some of the desserts with little flags - super patriotic and thoughtful.\n","Overall, I give this buffet 5 stars, A+++. Service was spot on as well, Super attentive. \n","Great attention to detail. \n","If you want a great meal, great dessert, and great service hit the Bacchanal. My only gripe was that the wait was long to get in, but 100% worth it.\n","before Hello,\n","\n","I couldn't find a place to leave feedback other than this email box. I hope it's an appropriate channel and my server (Jenna)  gets some sort of recognition.\n","I have been to Oreganos in Goodyear many many times. It's one of our favorite places to dine at.  I always experience good or average customer service. However on my visit on August 2, the service was amazing! Best I've had in any restaurant.   We had a server who was extremely sweet and attentive. She NEVER stopped smiling and made me feel comfortable every time she was at my table. My husband and I noticed her attentiveness the second time she came around. She was consistent and paid attention to detail. \n","Right before our visit was over, she noticed I hadn't eat one of my dishes. I told her it wasn't what I expected. She apologized and took it with her. She came back and had it removed from my check and offered to exchange for anything else. \n","We ended up getting desert, which is something we never do! \n","We appreciate everything she did for us and commend her on her customer service. \n","All the Little things she did,  matter so much and I'm so appreciative of Jenna. I will come back and ask to be seated with her every time I visit regardless of the wait I may experience. \n","\n","\n","Thank you for your time and attention!\n","\n","\n","Ps if Jenna ever needs a job, tell her to give me a call! :) \n","\n","Betty Romero\n","before This chipotle has the best customer service.  Food is always super fresh and tastes delicious. Best location!!\n","before I came ready to buy a car but not a single person approached my husband and I.\n","4 salesmen saw us and did not say a single thing. \n","We thought they were closed ! We even pulled up their hours to verify. \n","Horrible service\n","before If 0 stars would be available that's what I would give.\n","This place had the worst service ever!\n","We arrived late night and the place was empty.\n","Our server took our order and never came back in to check on us. After 45 mins we decided to ask about our meal and they told us it was normal to wait a while. Shortly after our waitress comes to our table and states she doesn't know what happened to our order so she's going to place it again and asks what we're having. She didn't empathize or say she was sorry. We literally stood up. On the way out I saw another employee and asked to speak to their boss and she stated she wasn't sure where the manager was at.\n","Do not recommend this place if you're looking to feel welcomed and appreciated as a customer.\n","before I went to streets earlier and have to say the food was amazingly delicious and the staff was so nice to me and got my food exactly the way I asked and I plan on coming back because it was so good there.\n","before Nice friendly people.I am a wimp when it comes to spice and I told them that and told me which was the least spicy and it was delectable!!!!!!!!\n","before I have been going to this location for years and never had problems until recently.  One one occasion I ordered the chicken piccata.  I was given chicken Alfredo.  I sent it back and it came out very quickly, the kitchen added lemon and capers to the Alfredo.  WRONG!  Again it went back and this time I got a reasonable facsimile of a piccata.  The next time I went in the bartender Chelsea ignored me for almost 20 minutes.  When she finally did come over she was rude and treated me like a second class subhuman piece of trash.  Today I went back and Chelsea was working again.  I had just returned from a hiking trip with friends and sat in the back of a Jeep for six hours.  I just wanted to have a drink and relax while I waited for an Uber to pick me up.  Unfortunately Chelsea's girlfriend was sitting at the bar and didn't shut up from the moment I walked in to the moment I left.  I'm not saying it's wrong to have friends come in when your working and everyone has the right to express themselves but there is a limit and boundaries need to be set.  Sorry Cheesecake Factory, you had your three strikes!\n","before I've been going to this location for years and through different owners.  Juut is by far the best.  The staff is always friendly and professional.  My stylist Raquel is the best.  She listens to what I want and designs my style to fit my lifestyle.  Way to go Raquel.\n","before I came here for the first time with a buddy who is originally from Chicago.  I let him order and I was blown away.  We got the classic pie and everything was fresh, from the mozzarella to the diced tomatoes.  If you have room for dessert, get the cookie pie.  Great  time.  Our server Hannah was awesome too!\n","before 190 Octane w\\/ a shot (or two) of Everclear!!!!  There's a reason why just about every review recommends this.  It will get you twisted for real!\n","\n","Fat Tuesday will be one my first stops when I go back to Vegas.  Just don't drink this and immediately go shopping like I did!\n","before Great buffet and beautiful food presentation. I came for brunch on Christmas Holiday and there was no line, so that was probably the highlight of the eatery. I wouldn't pay $70 for this buffet again being that I had to wait in line for 15-20minutes for warm crab legs. They need to find a better method for serving the most demanded item in their buffet. I say try it once but don't expect to get your food \"right away\" at this buffet.\n","before I've never actually stayed here (have been many times though) but I wanted to review anyways for their amazing customer service! I made a reservation from 2\\/21 to 2\\/23 for my sister's bachelorette weekend. Reservations were easy to make and the person I spoke with was great. Unfortunately, there was a death in the family and we were unable to go on this trip :( :( :(\n","\n","BUT, when I called the hotel and explained to them this madness, they were very understanding and gave me my full refund back on my deposit, despite the 48 hour cancellation notice requirement. I told the person I spoke with on the phone how deeply grateful I was for this understanding and would return when I come out next time. Now this is great customer service!!\n","\n","I can't wait to stay here when it comes time to hit up Vegas again (which I sure hope it soon!)\n","before Is Liberty Market my favorite place to eat? No, but it is unique, sits in downtown Gilbert and just has that \"likeability\" quality. Their food choices are classic (sandwiches, salads, pizzas) and for the most part, tasty. I like the ambience inside, everything is wide open and welcoming. Staff is friendly and prices are reasonable. I guess I just can't say I love anything I've tried here. The margherita pizza to me doesn't really resemble a margherita pizza. There aren't slices of tomato, basil and mozzarella on top but sliced really thin and almost could pass a cheese pizza without the small strips of basil on top. I also recently ventured to try a dessert, which was highly recommended by the cashier, and I really hated it. I don't remember the name of it but it was essentially a brownie\\/cookie made with corn flakes. It was overly sweet and had a very odd texture. No go for me! I recall breakfast choices being better and might go again soon to recall my distant memory.\n","before This weekend was my first time attending the festival and I enjoyed every minute I was there! The layout of the event was great, I especially loved the signs with arrows pointing to main points of attraction. Food vendors were aplenty and delicious! I invited many of my friends to attend, even a few from out of state. Everyone had a great time, especially during Hoobastank. Free parking and $10 admission is very reasonable and great for kids (who get in free). The event was pretty packed so I know lots of people enjoyed the festival as well. Plus, the time of year couldn't be better with such perfect weather. Hats off to everyone who puts this event together...job well done! I will be back for as long as this event is around!\n","before We came in towards closing one night and were greeted with friendly smiles and conversation from Mike (the owner). We told him it was our first time in and he was more than happy to go through the menu with us and proceeded to tell us his restaurant is known for their cheesesteaks. The rumble in my stomach and the smells of meat cooking got me to order one immediately with peppers, onions, mushrooms and cheese. We were told it would be about a 10 minute wait and were given complimentary fountain drinks in the meantime. We were also told the restaurant is getting painted and having some minor renovations to look less like an ice cream shop (ie: checkered floors, ice cream pictures posted, etc.). Place is cute with toys and candies for kids and a Coke machine with glass bottles. \n","\n","When our food arrived, the cheesesteaks were huge and overflowing with meats and toppings! The bread is heavenly mixed with the tender meat, veggies and melting cheese, WOW! I was super hungry and could barely finish the cheesesteak! This is definitely the right place to go if you are hungry and in need of good food!\n","\n","Oh, and I did get some ice cream to go (chocolate brownie) and that was also good. I could have done without the walnuts though.\n","\n","Will be back and lucky for me it's so close to home!\n","before Being on the property of Secret Garden is wonderful with the trees, beautiful garden and calm fountains. The House is quaint and I loved the feel of walking on wood floors, small rooms and actually feeling like you are in a old, beautiful home. I came here with a big party (11 of us total) and we had a nice table in front of a fireplace and Christmas tree. The Happy Hour menu was pretty limited but decided on the Essence Riesling ($6). Wine was crisp and tasted good. For dinner, I ordered an Artisan Cheese Board (to share) and the grilled romaine salad. The cheese board was nice, came with 3 cheeses for HH, grilled bread, raisins, nuts and I believe figs. The grilled romaine salad was not my thing at all...I don't know if it was the vinagrette or the stuff inside the lettuce but something just didn't work for me. I didn't eat it all and left hungry.\n","I did also sample the polenta fries but again, not my thing. They were mushy and the only thing that gave it some flavor was the sauce it came with. I wanted to try things I wouldn't normally try but I think next time, I'll stick to something simple (I keep hearing their burger is good). \n","\n","I did love the atmosphere, the company, the service. I didn't like the price tag. At Happy Hour, I walked away with a $33 bill for a glass of wine, cheese board and a salad. Their patio also looked really nice, especially at night with the trees lit up and the barn playing music. Overall, I think I would come back here because it really is a beautiful spot and the service was amazing!\n","before This place is SO cute for adults and for kids! They have tons of candy to choose from, many of which are hard to find, toys, books, etc. My shopping buddy picked out a few things for an upcoming grandchild and I was sucked into the candy. Service was a little slow but the lady at the counter told us she doesn't work there often. I didn't mind the wait though because it was fun to shop\\/look around at all the novelties. If you're looking for a little distraction in Old Town for the kiddos or just have a sweet tooth for candy, you should stop by!\n","before I'll keep this short and sweet- I came with a friend for HH one night and liked the vibe, food and service. The sushi rolls here are above average and I liked the variety. The surf and turf roll was really delicious and I would recommend it. The prices here were pretty high so be prepared.\n","before We went here late one night for dinner because it was the only Mexican place open past 10PM. The bar was the only place available to sit down so we ordered drinks and got chips and salsa. I ordered the albondigas soup and a bean burro. The soup was extremely salty, too salty to the point where I told our waiter I wasn't able to eat it. The burro was OK, I only ordered it because it was on the a la carte menu and cheap. I will say the service was pretty fast and attentive but it still isn't saving it for me to return anytime soon.\n","before I've gone here twice and had good experiences both times. Service is a litle slow so I wouldn't come here if you are in a hurry. But, what I would recommend is to come here and enjoy the extreme deliciousness that is Chompies.\n","\n","I've had the Jewish sliders (which are incredible!), the knish, cheese blintz, pastrami sandwich and the chicken matzo ball soup. MUST HAVE THE MATZO BALL SOUP!! I did feel quite full after sharing a large bowl though so prepare for a lot of soup. The knish I had was the potato and onion. I liked it but it was very one note after a while. I had a few bites of my boyfriends mile high pastrami sandwich on challah bread and it was divine!! The challah bread was sweet and amazing and the pastrami was perfect! The blintz is a good sweet dish but also savory. Probably wouldn't come here if you are on a diet.\n","\n","Prices are decent, decor is cool and the bakery walking in\\/out is amazing. They also serve Dr. Brown, which is great soda if you've never had it. Good food, good location, good experiences. Will be back!\n","before I've been here twice now, first time for tires and the second for an oil change. Service here is pretty slow and employee's always seem to be scrambling, like they are under-staffed. It took an hour and a half for an oil change and this is with me calling the day before and making an appointment. I don't really understand why they take appointments if they can't get you in and have you wait like you just walked in. The only reason I came back was because if you buy 2 new tires, you get a free oil change voucher. It was nice not to pay for an oil change and my tires are great, no problems whatsoever.\n","before I tried Body Solutions as a Groupon offer. My sister and I bought 6 treatments for 2 small areas for $99. That's a steal if you ask me!\n","\n","I decided to treat my forearms and chin. I had never been to a laser place before and had never recieved laser hair removal. I was hesitant but willing to try something to remove virtually pain free and more permanent to remove this unwanted hair!!\n","\n","For the first few treatments, I didn't see a lot of results but was reassured by staff that it could take up to 6 treatments. Around my 5th treatment, I noticed a huge difference on my arm hair growth and was very excited! After my last treatment, I didn't see a lot of difference with my chin but did with my arms. I rarely shave those areas anymore and am very pleased with the results. \n","\n","Overall, the staff was friendly and very willing to answer any questions. I was able to schedule appointments on weekends, which was a huge convenience for me since I live far and work during the week. The place was clean and very professional. I would recommend this place for sure!\n","before I come here if I want a pedicure every couple months because it's close to my house. Depending on the day and time, it can get really busy so I would suggest going later in the day on weekdays (they close at 7pm). The staff working there are friendly and accomodating. It's definitely not top of the line but it's nice enough. For a basic pedicure, it's around $20 but I always get callus removal, which is a $5 charge. I've gotten a gel manicure here before too and was told it would last 2 weeks without chips. Mine lasted 5 days before it started looking bad. I'm not really into manicures anyways. One thing I do like about this place is you can just walk in and not have to make an appointment. I wish the pedicures lasted a little longer and that they used hot rocks like competing nail salons but it's still a nice time to relax.\n","before This place is unlike any other. First of all, the name is unusual. The restaurant is tucked away and has trees surrounding the building. It almost feels like you're away from Arizona. The place is set up like a deli but also like a small store and a coffee bar and an art gallery and a patio space...super unique. I love the selection of foods and beverages. Ordering is simple (that is when you know what you want) and you have a chance to browse through the aisles as you wait for your order. They also have a loft space upstairs to enjoy your food but there's seating downstairs and outside on multiple patios. Perfect place for a weekday lunch or a brunch with your friends.\n","before I've gone here a few times and have always liked the food and service. I like coming for their happy hour (and reverse happy hour). Their menu is huge (think Cheesecake Factory) but everything I have had is good. The ambience of the restaurant is nice, not a big place but it's cool to see the brewery through the glass next to the restaurant. I would recommend the pizza!! They also do a pizza cookie but I LOVE the fact they have a brownie...mmm! They also do a trio of cookies, which is amazing. The only con's would be price and their chips \u0026 salsa. Both can be improved :)\n","before My review is specifically related to the bridal department:\n","\n","I've had the pleasure of ordering a bridesmaids dress through Nordstrom's before with a fabulous experience so I came here to look at bridesmaids dresses for my wedding. I was in LOVE with the Donna Morgan dresses, specifically the candy apple green color for my outside garden wedding. 3 of my girls, my mom and I came in on our Sunday morning appointment and were treated so well. Terri is very accommodating and sweet- she even called me in advance to let me know the Donna Morgan dresses were running a 25% off sale at the time of my appointment! We got the fitting room to our party and loved having the girls try on the dresses. We ended up picking the dress I had my eye on and everyone loves their dress! Dresses came in a WEEK later and were shipped to my girls living out of state in less than a week. Amazing experience, amazing dress and a really good price! Thank you Terri and the Nordstrom's team for making this experience so wonderful!\n","before I love sushi and have been to several revolving sushi bars around the Valley. I was in the area of Kiku and thought I would stop in for a weekday lunch. I sat by the bar- my server was nice but not attentive. After waiting 15-20 min for sashimi, I ended up asking the owner what happened and she gave me some free miso soup. I appreciate the effort but the soup was terrible. The sushi unfortunately wasn't good quality so everything tasted off. I wanted to like it but the salmon sashimi literally was 3 different colors. All of the revolving sushi I ate was warm and that surprised me because I got there maybe 30 min after opening. For a $30 lunch plus tip, this was really disappointing. \n","\n","Overall, if you really like sushi, I would skip this place.\n","before My family and I decided to go here for my dad's 60th birthday. I was excited to try a new restaurant. The service was amazing! We had waiters and people with meat coming constantly so bravo on service. The salad bar was good but nothing spectacular for the price. I also didn't enjoy every meat option I had (I had 8 out of 12). I remember the lamb being disappointing. I left the restaurant extremely full but not extremely satisfied. I'm glad I tried it but honestly, this place isn't for me.\n","before Famous Dave's has been a family favorite dinner place since I moved to the Mesa Riverview area. We have enjoyed everything from a casual dinner to birthdays here. We always order the family platter, which is a massive amount of food! Their pork, brisket and ribs are the best! The cornbread is also great.\n","\n","For around $70, you can feed 6 people and still have food to take home! The BBQ sauces are also tasty with the chips they bring out before the food. I like the sweet and tangy sauce the best. \n","\n","The best part about Dave's BBQ is that they do FREE dinners for anyone named David or Dave on their anniversary. That's been a benefit for me since my dad is David and a good friend is Dave. Only thing I've ever had here that I wouldn't order again is the chocolate brownie dessert. The flavor of the brownie was off and I didn't enjoy it.\n","\n","Good food, fun vibe and friendly staff here. Would recommend!\n","before I've been to this location a few times but last night was the WORST service I've had at a restaurant in a very long time. We got here a little before reverse happy hour so we waited to order food and drinks until 9pm. Our waitress barely came to our table to check on us and the place was pretty dead. We ordered our food at 9:10, got our pot stickers appetizer at 9:45pm. I ordered a sangria and it took about 20 minutes for it to come out. Our friends couldn't get a refill on water and iced tea to save their life...the list goes on and on here. All of our entrees were cold and tasted like they had been re-heated and sitting under a heat lamp for a while. Really not appetizing and we all left hungry. When we asked to speak to the manager, she offered us a \"free\" dessert and after 30 minutes of waiting, we walked over to the hostess stand and waited to speak to her again. At this point, we didn't even want the dessert or anything to do with the place. Oh, and on top of everything, the place was FREEZING!! Yes that sounds great in the summer but it was unbearably cold. Overall, this is a very poorly run restaurant with very poor service. We were comped the food and offered a couple coupons but I am certain I will never come back here!!\n","before First of all, who doesn't love a 24 hour drive thru?? I tried this place after hearing nothing but amazing things to test it out for myself. I tried the chocolate sprinkles, glaze and devils food cake donuts. They were all amazing!! I was also pleasantly surprised to find out they have boba teas as well. Next time I go, I will be trying one of those too!\n","before Essence was an impulse stop for me as I was driving on University. I decided  to stop in after reading \"bakery and cafe\" from their sign. As I pulled in, I noticed the line through the window of the tiny restaurant. I walked in and had to squish my way to the back of the line through people sitting at tables and people already in line. The restaurant is tiny but they do have a  patio for additional seating. Line moved pretty quickly but noticed their bakery display was pretty limited. This made me sad because I was excited to see all the goodies that a bakery would have offered. \n","\n","I went to order and asked the cashier her recommendations since this was my first time visiting. She recommended the salad (only a few to choose from) and the grilled cheese with tomato, mozzarella and basil sandwich. I went with the sandwich and was given the choice of mixed greens or potato salad. I chose mixed greens. I also decided to order a vanilla bean macaroon because I wanted to try a bakery item. Total (without drink) was over $11, so not super cheap. Drinks were expensive, even a can of soda was $1.25. \n","\n","I took the order to go and waited about 10 minutes for my food. When I got home, I was disappointed to see the mixed greens were literally big pieces of lettuce with a vinagrette rather than an actual salad with veggies. The sandwich was OK, the bread was really good. The macaroon was good, soft outside and gooey buttercream frosting inside. I didn't eat it all at once because I found the texture somewhat unappealing and a little too rich. \n","\n","I think I would come back for breakfast (I hear it's better) rather than during the busy lunch rush.\n","before As far as ice cream goes, everything tastes and smells really good. It's just not what I was expecting or hoping for as far as atmosphere. I thought it would resemble an old school ice cream parlor and soda fountain but it doesn't. The sign on the back of the building is also confusing because it says they have Italian beef and other savory items that they definitely don't have when walking inside. I ordered a 1 scoop sundae and it was over $5. Very pricy! We also saw the employees not wearing gloves and touching their hands on their faces and surfaces while making the cones and serving the food, which was off putting.\n","\n","Overall, very average to me. DQ is just down the street and is half the price.\n","before I've been to San Tan Brewery a few times and have had good expeiences overall. My favorite beer is the Mr. Pineapple! One of the best beers I have ever had in my entire life!!! The food is also good and offers a lot of variety. I particularly like the daily selection choices. My favorite dish has been the street tacos. Staff is also very friendly and has a good overall vibe.\n","before I came here on a Saturday night to watch an ASU game and have a nice dinner. It's located right off Scottsdale Road, easily visible from the street. There was no wait when we came (around 8PM) but very packed. We were seated at a bar top and were quickly greeted by our waiter. I decided to order a raspberry margarita, which was pretty good. I do prefer margaritas on the rocks and this one was frozen. I ordered a caesar salad to start and the chicken alfredo. The alfredo pasta came with rotini noodles, which I liked but reminded me slightly of a macaroni and cheese. The portion was HUGE though, definitely share or plan to take a lot home! Everything was good, the place has a bunch of TV's and the bar area with the TV on was really loud. If you don't like to watch sports while eating\\/drinking, I probably wouldn't come here. But, if you don't mind it or like it, it's a fun place to check out. \n","\n","Overall, I had a good time and would recommend.\n","before First of all, I'm pretty sure this place is closed. Not just closed but no longer in business. I drove by recently and saw the signs in the window \"For Lease\". Based on my last experience at Luke's, I know why. I've been to Luke's many times before and always had solid food. The customer service is minimal at best but nothing bad to report per say. I raved and raved about this place to my boyfriend and so we finally stopped by one night. He ordered the Italian beef and it was literally the driest meat I've ever seen\\/tasted. It did not appear the meat had been soaked in anything and the sandwich was so dry! I was so disappointed he got this sandwich because I've tried their Italian beefs before and they were good. I don't know if they stopped caring because they know they were going to close down or if they forgot to soak the meat. So, I now have a different opinion of Luke's, especially since Portillo's are popping up nearby.\n","before I've been to Bookman's a few times and have mixed feelings about it. If you're going just to look around, it's fun to see all the stuff they have in there. Between the movie selection, CD's, books and trinkets, it was fun to shop around. But, as someone interested in selling to them, I would never do that again. I brought in a huge selection of books I was interested in selling and they only took 4 of the books and offered me a few measely dollars. I was shocked. I understand they need to make a profit but I wasn't even getting $1 for each book they wanted. A total rip off if you ask me and a waste of time waiting for them to look through my stuff. I'm not sure if I will be returning anytime soon.\n","before My experience here was a bit unique...I came as part of a Wedding Expo event with my sister, mom and aunt. The outside of this place is nice and relaxing, tables set up at the event to sit and relax, especially on a nice day. As a note, if you are handicapped or have trouble walking, the ground here is really uneven and can easily trip if you're not careful. My mom uses a cane to walk and had to help her several times just to walk on the property. There are also some stairs too. Guess that's part of the old home charm...\n","\n","Bungalow is set up like an old home and when we walked inside, we saw a fire place to the left and a \"dining room\" to the right. The coffee shop is set near the fire place and is indeed very charming. However, we were a little put off when we tried to order black tea as a gift to someone who loves to try local coffee shops. The cashier told us he wasn't able to sell us the tea. Umm what?! I mean I know it's Sunday but why be open if you can't sell all your product(s)? We then made our way to the \"backyard\" and loved the ceremony type set up. In my perspective, if you are looking to host a casual event with a unique set up, I would suggest Bungalow. For more upscale events, I would look elsewhere.\n","before The concept of a car wash\\/boutique\\/restaurant was completely unique and unexpected as I arrived for a Yelp event. We dropped off my car, walked inside and were greeted with nice smells, smiling employees and tons of merchandise! We were able to sample a couple brews, wines, food and dessert during our duration, all while getting a free car wash! The food was tasty, I especially liked the brisket tacos and coleslaw. The desserts were also very good...I tried the oreo cupcake and a cookie. Employees were quick to take your empty plates away and refill your drinks almost instantaneously, 5 star service for sure! \n","\n","As we walked around the market, we noticed kitchy items, wines, car products, beverages galore, clothes, scarves...the list goes ON AND ON! Of course, everything was completely overpriced but that is to be expected in Scottsdale. The cute coasters I wanted were almost $40 for 4...yeah right! We didn't catch the demos and after wandering around the store, we walked out to get the car. The car wasn't there so we walked to the front to ask someone where it was then were told to walk to the back (again) to get the car, where were told it was parked in the front. That was confusing...good thing my car was left in a garage type area next to an incredible Lambo! Keys were left inside my car after the car wash, which made me a little uncomfortable because who knows who could have hopped a wall and drove off with my car. \n","\n","We ended up getting gas at another store (gas here is at least 20 cents more a gallon than most) and upon further inspection, noticed the car wash wasn't very good. I noticed lots of white spots on my black car and had to wipe down areas that the attendants should have...at least it was a free car wash. I don't live anywhere close to here so it was a nice surprise to come here and enjoy a different experience. I think this place would do really well out in a rural area or be a great stop on a long road trip for good food and merchandise.  Maybe an idea for expansion?\n","\n","Thank you Tom's Thumb and Yelp for a overall good time.\n","before The wait and line can seem intimidating but I finally went to Farmhouse for Sunday brunch. The wait was 15 min, no big deal. If there's nobody outside,  write your name and party number on the clipboard outside to get your name down on the list. We went inside and the restaurant is so charming but small. Tables get turned quickly. We were seated in a booth and given a menu with one side breakfast and one side lunch. I went with the Belgian waffle and my fiance had the #18 scrambler. Food came out quickly and portions are just right. Food was decent, I thought my fiance's food was better than my waffle. Prices are good, much better than other breakfast options nearby. I would come again.\n","before I went here today for the first time with a friend and I really enjoyed the \"betty boop\". It came with one big waffle and a chicken thigh. The waffle was good, tasted like cinnamon, and the chicken was juicy and delicious! I also ordered a rasberry kool-aid just because it was available and I enjoyed that as well! I loved how quick we got the food and how attentive the servers were, even the host was great! \n","\n","I would come back for the chicken and waffles but also to try their \"soul food\".\n","before I've come here a few times for lunch, as this spot is pretty close to my work. If you're looking for someplace quick to get good sushi, this is it! I wouldn't say this is the best sushi I've ever had but it will definitely satisfy that sushi craving. Some of the names of the rolls definitely crack me up...playboy roll? Sexy roll? LOL!\n","\n","All in all, good place to check out.\n","before Gammage is a nice theatre but incredibly outdated! The carpet is so worn and stained, bathrooms are practically non-existent with a few stalls in each and parking can be a problem if you don't arrive at least an hour before show time. Besides the long bathroom lines, the bar set up here is set up so a line forms into the passing walkway, which gets incredibly congested and you're literally shoulder to shoulder with people just to pass by. I've had drinks spilled on me as people are squeezing by just to get to their seats. Oh, and don't forget the incredible food\\/drink markup. $10 for a cocktail! Once you arrive in the theatre, the seats are so small and uncomfortable (think airplane seat but worse). $111 a ticket (with tax) to see a Broadway play in such an uncomfortable seat for almost 3 hours was almost unbearable. \n","\n","The show itself was good but the theatre is sub-par at best. I will definitely think twice before wanting to see another production here.\n","before I live nowhere near here (thank God!) but have had their donuts from co-workers bringing them in and have been in store. I recently tried the Texas kolache, which is a breaded sausage and cheese pastry. You can get it spicy or not, I chose for the not spicy warmed up. It was delicious! As far as donuts, their glazed is addicting. I also got an iced chai, which was very flavorful and delicious. Restaurant inside has bar seating and a few tables. Staff is also really friendly. Overall winner here!!\n","before I love the fact that HH prices are really cheap and the food was decent. I got HH tacos, a margarita and split a cookie dessert with tip and was under $15. Not bad! The ambience reminds me of San Felipe's and Salty Senorita. My friend and I sat outside and was a little loud with all the noise from Mill and the planes coming down. It has a really nice bar though with tv's that can be watched inside and outside. I can see this place popping for night life because when we went for HH, it wasn't very busy. Service was also a bit slow, I remember commenting to my friend about how long it took for us to receive our food. All in all I was glad to have tried it and would probably return.\n","before I've dined in twice and have ordered take out from here many times as this place is about 5 minutes from my home. It's cool this joint was featured on DDD and has some decorations from the occasion inside. My personal favorites are the baked ziti pizza, antipasto salad and chicken \u0026 eggplant parmesan. The garlic knots are also really good when you eat in! Very casual inside but the food is pretty good. We will keep returning!\n","before I live in the area and come to this mall only if I need to do some quick shopping. The mall seems small because there's not much to do there. Many of the stores are vacant and there are very few \"name brand\" stores. They don't have a movie theatre there anymore (the one nearby shutdown) and the food court is nothing special. I usually spend about 2 hours there, tops. There is a pretty nice kids area and a lot of kids were playing so that is a big draw for families with little ones. Overall, I wouldn't expect much coming here. It's not the worst mall I've ever been to but I much prefer Scottsdale Fashion Square and Chandler Mall, even though both are somewhat of a drive for me.\n","before This was my first time in and didn't really know what to expect. I guess I was going to compare it to YC's but it's really not the same. Genghis is a sit down restaurant where you create your own bowl, add sauce and they cook for you. I liked the selection of proteins, veggies and the array of sauces. I had someone helping me on all my selections and really enjoyed being able to sample sauces. When I got to the cooking station, I liked that you could add extra ingredients (I chose an egg). Service here was really great and I enjoyed my bowl! \n","\n","I would definitely come back!\n","before I truly feel that this theatre is a gem! Ticket prices are cheaper than Harkins and AMC and it's a really nice theatre. They just re-modeled the parking lot and the complex around there so it's really nice to visit. The theatre itself is clean, nice AC and doesn't have as many people as Harkins. I've never had a problem here and come here often to avoid the crazy crowds at Tempe Marketplace. Plus, I live across the street so it's very close. It's definitely worth checking out!\n","before I think it can be challenging to find good seafood in the desert but High Tide is amazing! It's located on the southwest corner of Val Vista and Williams Field Rd in a shopping complex. Hubby and I came on a Tuesday evening, so it wasn't crowded. I really liked the ambience of the restaurant and the smell of seafood as you walk in. Service was great- I also enjoyed reading their weekly specials board. We started with the calamari, which was probably the best I've ever had! The dipping sauces are great, perfectly breaded and not chewy. I ordered the Tide Roast steam pot and my husband ordered the gumbo. Both of us raved about our food and loved how much seafood we got in each dish! I probably counted 15 shrimp in mine along with the crab and crawfish meats. It also came with rolls, which were perfect to dip in our entrees! I also liked on the menu that there were other options for those who don't like or eat seafood. Honestly, I will always eat the seafood when I come back!\n","\n","Overall, High Tide was great and we cannot wait to return!\n","before Unlike it's neighboring store, this place actually has cute vintage stuff and AC! I liked the fact that \"I Love Lucy\" was playing on old TV's and set up just like a living room from 1950. There were also 2 adorable bathrooms with kitchy stuff inside to buy. I also liked the snack table, which included free popcorn, candy and cookies. How clever! I didn't end up buying anything here but really liked it. Just be careful walking around...very tight spaces and stuff everywhere! I would probably return.\n","before I came here on a Friday night with some friends to enjoy the nice weather and have a couple brews. Parking is close by in a dirt lot with just a quick walk over to the front. Friendly staff and one of the owners greeted us right away as we went upstairs. A nice crowd of people were there, enjoying their drinks with friends. The bar upstairs was slammed so drinks took about 10 minutes to get. I started with a San Tan Hefe, which was cold and delicious. I was with a big group and were able to sit on the nice couches and then moved to an area with smaller tables to nibble on appetizers. The food choices are different but did enjoy what we ordered. Our group had the chips and salsa, which came with 3 different dips. We also ordered the cheese platter and the hummus. The hummus does have a kick, which I wasn't expecting, so I stuck with just eating the veggies. Cheese platter was delicious, especially with a nice cold beer. Chips and dip were good too. \n","\n","Servers were around to take orders, which made getting drinks and food easy. They do have angry orchard, which I ordered next. The view, weather and vibe of the Perch was really awesome and my favorite part. It is so relaxing to drink, hang out and just enjoy other people's company. I talked with many new people that night, including the owners. James came over to personally thank us for coming and asked if he could get us anything. Personally, I think that is awesome and makes me want to come back even more. Oh, and the women's bathroom is decorated really cute, nice touch!\n","\n","Yes, this place is new and does still have kinks to work out. It's truly a unique spot and I really had a great time. I can't wait to come back and enjoy, whether it's with a group of friends or on a date with my boyfriend.\n","\n","Great job James, keep up the good work!!\n","before This is another one of those reviews where I wish I could leave half stars. Since I can't, I'm giving it a lower grade because I just don't think it's worth 4 stars. For lunch, this place definitely hits the spot and tastes good. I have 2 criticisms though. One, I do not understand paying the exact same for a sandwich because their options vary in meat selection and non-meat selections. A turkey and provolone should not cost the same as a meat stuffed with 4-5 different meats. Just sayin. And two, which is my biggest criticism, is they are ONLY OPEN UNTIL 5PM?!?!?! What kind of crap is that?!?! How much business is this place losing by closing so early? I came here for dinner once and was shooed away at the door at 4:59PM. Wow.\n","\n","All in all, this place is good and would recommend. Their meat and cheeses are sliced fresh every order and I do like the fact there are 2 separate counters for ordering. Prices are also reasonable, way better than Jersey Mike's. Location here isn't awesome, it's a little hidden off Broadway and 48th street. It's next to Papa John's so when you see that, turn into the complex with Staples.  It's minutes from work so I am somewhat of a regular here. Will keep coming back because it's yummy!\n","before I was misled into this place thinking it was a revolving sushi bar but when I walked inside, it was clearly not. I was seated in a booth and my waitress did not speak very good English. I had to call her over every time I wanted to order or needed a refill on my water. I did come in for lunch and was told about the all you can eat lunch. I felt this was a good deal so I ordered. The flavor of the sushi was just OK- nothing tasted great. \n","\n","I would not return.\n","before I had the opportunity to try Waffle Crush recently at an event. My sister has been waiting patiently to find an event nearby by following WC through Instagram...plus she might have a slight waffle obsession. The line moved quickly and the menu of options ranges from pre-made creations to a \"build your own\" concept. The \"Nana\" with it's banana and nutella goodness looked too good to pass up so we ordered that and a can of soda, which was a total of $8. After a 10 minute wait, the waffle came out. Between the 2 of us, we didn't finish the plate because it was so rich and the waffle was very dense. I can't say I didn't like it but I won't be spending $7 any time soon to get another one. Oh well.\n","before I would never have thought to stop here if it wasn't for the Yelp Shopping Crawl for Local Businesses but I am sure glad it was on the list to go! Velvet is a cozy store with cute clothes, accessories and very friendly staff! I personally didn't buy anything here but my shopping buddy found a few Christmas gifts for her nieces. They did have a shawl piece, which can be worn many ways, but was a little out of my price range at $48. Once I obtain a little more spending money, I will be sure to return!\n","before I've been to Vegas many times but never to Harley-Davidson...until this weekend. I must say, I am definitely a fan! Everyone in my party raved about their mac n' cheese so of course, I have to order it! It definitely lived up to the hype...OMG! SO good! I loved the motorcycle displays and staff was really attentive\\/friendly.\n","\n","I would recommend for a cool\\/laid back place to eat on the strip!\n","before I pass by this place everyday driving down Cooper\\/Stapley and decided on a whim to go for dinner one night with my boyfriend. It was very crowded when we arrived but the line wasn't long (thank God) but paid almost $30 for 2. Everything was categorized by stations so we started with the salad bar, which was closest to the booth in which we were seated. Everything looked fresh and dove right in, bringing back some Clam Chowder soup as well. No complaints with the salad bar, just needed to add some salt and pepper to the soup. Next we went around to the rest of the stations, where there were options of chicken, steak, ham, pizza, taco bar and assorted sides. Food looked like it had been sitting out for a long time and there were hardly any healthy options to choose from. When I came back and started eating, everything I ate was horrible. The chicken was extremely dry, the ham that was sliced to order was not moist and had this overly sweet and hard glaze to it. My boyfriend got a steak and he said for the cut of meat it was, which wasn't good, was cooked well and at least edible. We also tried the popcorn \"shrimp\" when we realized it wasn't actual shrimp. The taco \"meat\" was truly a mystery as well. Nothing had flavor and everything was so dry. Gross.\n","\n","As for sides, the mashed potatoes were awful and the mac and cheese was mediocre at best. I didn't touch the pizza, as it looked nasty. My boyfriend and I did not finish our plates and debated just grabbing dessert and leaving. We walked to the dessert bar, where the options were a plenty but not too appetizing. The chocolate fountain with strawberries was the best thing I ate. The apple cobbler and peach cobbler were giant blobs of canned fruit disasters. We were still hungry so we went to grab more salad but when we walked back to the salad bar, everything was taken away and being cleaned with bleach. I wondered why they were bleach cleaning during the middle of rush hour dinner service...the smell permeated the entire area, which made wanting to eat even more unappealing. So, we scratched that idea.  \n","\n","Golden Corral, we tried to like you but you just make it very tough with your step below \"cafeteria\" style food. It was also very dirty inside and décor is very outdated, which makes the place seem even more dirty. Our server was also annoyingly loud and was singing to every song being played on the radio. Really, people don't want to hear your squealing during dinner. I couldn't wait to leave.\n","before I came here to watch a Cardinals game and for Happy Hour, which is from 3-7pm. I was really craving a nice margarita so when I walked up to the bar and asked the bartender for a drink menu, he snarkily replied \"we don't have one\". Hmm ok...so I will just trust they have a good house margarita...boy was I wrong!! OMG DO NOT ORDER the margaritas, they are disgusting!! I even asked for sugar around the rim and they gave me salt instead. Whatever...so we are standing at the bar (no seating available at the time) and next I ordered a beer on draft. The glasses were NOT chilled so my beer became warm really quickly. What kind of bar doesn't chill the glasses for beer? From then on, I just stuck with bottled beer because I knew it would be cold and delicious, which it was :)\n","\n","I didn't order any food because I was standing the whole time and had no where to eat. But, this place has TONS of TV's so it was fun to watch the game. They also have air hockey and other arcade type games too for entertainment. I think I would come back and try the food but their HH drinks were not good!! HH prices were excellent though...bottled beer was $1.75 and the margarita was $3. Maybe I should come on Tuesday for $1 tacos? Who knows..\n","before I love a good sub and Firehouse is a pretty solid choice for me. I always get a hot sub and it's delicious! Food does take a few minutes to get to you so it's not super \"fast\" food but still can eat in or take to go. Prices are between $5-10 a sub, depending on size, toppings, meats etc. \n","\n","Good choice, close to home, will be back.\n","before I came here for a quick lunch with my boyfriend near our jobs and was definitely impressed! Location is great, right off of Baseline and 24th street inside the same complex as Wal Mart, Taco Bell, Jersey Mike's and Chipotle. The restaurant was clean and staff was very friendly. I ordered the spinach and goat cheese salad and picked at my boyfriend's \"smashed\" sweet potato fries. Smashed fries include rosemary and other spices...mmm! The sweet potato fries in general are really good! My salad was awesome, I've had their burger and chicken sandwiches before and everything I have had is great! Prices are a little steep (almost $20 for 2 at lunch without drinks) but good food indeed! Will be back!\n","before I used to think Tropicana was a dump but after the remodel, the place looks great! It looks really clean and modern inside, definitely a place you want to hang out.  Our party checked out the pool and had a great time! Good size pool, swim up blackjack, bar..I mean what else could you ask for? Food options looked amazing (I didn't eat here but saw all the places). A couple of friends had a room here and the room was also very nicely remodeled! Love gambling here for the cheap tables but looks nothing like before...go check it out! I think I might stay here next time I'm in Vegas!\n","before I would absolutely 1000% recommend Prenatal Premiere for an ultrasound! I went for a 3D\\/4D ultrasound at 33 weeks and loved that they had Sunday appointments! I was able to invite my family to attend, as they have comfortable couches and a huge screen (think theatre style). Seating is enough for 10, I had 8. Service here was excellent, our technician was really nice and very informative\\/thorough. We received some beautiful photos and her heartbeat in a stuffed animal. My family and I had a wonderful experience and I would definitely recommend coming here!\n","before Chinese and mexican together?! Yes please! This place is really great and I can't believe tonight was my first time trying it!! Location is a little hidden but once you pass Dobson, it's clearly visible (turn right after Circle K). Restaurant is really large and staff was really friendly. Since it was my first time in, they let me sample a few of their menu items. I thought that was really cool! I ended up ordering the jade chicken (similar to sweet and sour), gringo chicken in a quesadilla with chicken fried rice and refried beans. We ordered to go and waited about 10-15 minutes for our food. When we got home, I was excited to try all the food! Quesadilla was amazing...jade chicken great, beans good and rice was OK. I LOVE that they give you a warm snicker doodle too! Cookie was really good and the perfect way to end the meal. Overall, this place is great and will return soon!\n","before I had the pleasure of attending a luncheon meeting on the Tuscany @ McCormick Ranch property and was blown away! The grounds are stunning, the restaurant and food were great and the staff were very knowledgeable and welcoming. I was able to take a tour and see a vacant villa, which is beautiful! I would recommend saying hello and taking time to visit here!\n","before This year was my first time going and had an excellent time! I loved how many breweries there were represented from across Arizona and other states. I don't remember every beer I tried but I do remember leaving quite \"happy\".  Props to the event planners for thinking of everything, including the cooler fans that felt amazing on a warm day! I will definitely come back next year!\n","before I had the pleasure of attending Rustler's Rooste for my company's Christmas party. The restaurant is really fun and enjoyed the atmosphere immensely. The slide...is awesome! The view and patio are also great! The only thing I wasn't a huge fan of was the meats we were served at the luncheon. The steak was more than well done and the chicken was dry. I know if I came back to the restaurant and had the chance to order something else, I would be happy. Also, for some reason, I couldn't connect to their Wi-Fi. I would have loved to post on social media that I was there but my phone wouldn't connect.  \n","\n","I want to come back sometime in the evening to enjoy music, the view and the company. I will return!\n","before I cannot begin to express how much I love this place! Up until recently, I had only picked up gifts here but now, I have some balsamic vinegars and oils to try for myself! Taste away here and have employees mix flavors for you to try, it is so delicious! Bottles range from $16-18 a piece but will last a long time! Outrageous is tucked in a small shopping quarter across from Rusty Spur Saloon and next to Del Sol. Walk around and stumble upon this gem and discover new inspirations for cooking or gifts! Will keep returning!\n","before I have used David's Bridal for two occasions but for this review, I am going to only discuss my experience as a bride buying my wedding dress. I scheduled 2 appointments and on the second appointment (which I brought my family) I was given a new consultant. She was very sweet and I did end up saying \"yes to the dress\". I received a call a few weeks earlier than expected that my dress was in- I was ecstatic! I went in to get my dress and it was in horrible condition!! The jewels were falling off the threads, there were BLUE stains under the armpits and it looked dirty...it honestly looked like it had been worn. I asked if the dresses came in new and they reassured me they are all brand new and come from their warehouse in Washington DC. I was so disappointed in the dress that I did not take it and requested a new one to be shipped out. A couple weeks later, I get a call saying it was in and I could pick it up. This time, I took my mom and sister with me to pick up the dress. It looked great! \n","\n","Alterations- the main lady is really rude just FYI!! For my first fitting, my mom, sister and I went and while she was pinning and tucking away- she literally told us to be quiet! Are you kidding me?! We weren't being that loud- just enjoying our time together. Second time around she wasn't there and dealt with someone else. Alterations were good- just really expensive. They also do a complimentary steam- which we waited about a week before the wedding to do. All in all, they have beautiful dresses here for good prices so it's worth a look. It's also nicer and more boutique feeling than the other David's Bridal locations. I just wouldn't expect great customer service.\n","before Small restaurant but great service- I ordered the lunch special. Pizza was excellent but does take a few minutes to come out. I would return\n","before As a relatively new resident of Gilbert, I am always looking for new places to try. Black bear diner caught my interest and finally came here on a Sunday during brunch hours. Not the best time of day to go (long wait) but we finally got in and seated. The décor is adorable. I love diners and this place has all the typical diner stuff and more! We started with a cherry bearclaw and wow was it tasty! Breakfast came with HUGE portions. Service was attentive and good.  As we went to the front to pay, the chocolate cream pie looked too good to pass up so I took one home for a dinner dessert. Pie was good served cold, not room temp.\n","\n","I will definitely come back here!\n","before A friend of mine raves about this place and I finally got the chance to check it out for a weekday lunch. I almost missed it off 40th street, signage is hardly noticeable unless you are up close to the restaurant. I walked inside and the restaurant is small and casual. Staff is very friendly and I even got to say hello to the owner. I went through the menu and decided on the Texas BBQ burger with sweet potato tots. Order comes out pretty quickly but I notice the portions are pretty small. The burger itself was tasty- I liked that it was different but very messy to eat. The sweet potato tots were also good but the ranch for some reason was very off to me. It wasn't the white, creamy stuff I'm used to, rather almost a yellowish color and very thick. I didn't like that. Overall, I liked P.V. Burger Company and would go again.\n","before In my experience, there aren't a lot of stores who sell the items Mary Immaculate has around the Valley. I've gone here a couple times and have enjoyed my experiences. It may be a little overwhelming for some but there are a lot of religious books and trinkets to choose from here. Staff is helpful and personable. Will be returning today to purchase a St. Michael pendant as a gift to a friend who just graduated the police academy. My only complaint is how expensive everything is!\n","before Just like the 5 stars review says, Woohoo! As good as it gets! My friend knows the owners and I love the flowers here! They are beautiful, probably the best flowers I've seen! I know they are a bit pricey but if you're serious about flowers, this place is it! Great service, great store, great flowers. Done.\n","before I think the hype of this place is overrated however, you can definitely tell this place is more authentic than most. Some of the servers didnt even speak English. Hubby and I came for dinner on a weeknight and we barely got a table to sit and eat, we had the table in the back corner (the smallest table there). Service was pretty non-existent because there were so many people there so we ordered drinks and food at the same time. For a place that's called house of egg roll, you would expect egg rolls. They had 1 option on the menu and were then told they were out of egg rolls! We got egg drop soup, Mongolian beef, general tso's chicken and house biang biang noodles. Everything was super bland. The house biang biang noodles were gross, just my opinion. The Mongolian beef was the best thing we ate. Food did come out quickly, which was nice. We didn't get approached for a refill on drinks or to see how everything was. We had to wave down someone just to get the check. I think this place would be great for takeout but definitely not a nice dine in experience.\n","before I had a similar experience to several of the reviews already posted (cancelled appointments, rescheduling issues, problems with relaxation of salon). I too purchased a Groupon deal, I mean who could pass up a 1 hour massage, 30 min facial and pedicure for $69? I knew it sounded too good to be true..\n","\n","I first made my appointment for 9\\/14 and when I came in, I was told my appointment was never on record. I remembered the guy's voice who I had spoken with to make the initial appointment and talked with him about my confusion for the appointment never being on record. He remembered me and offered me 50% off a service. That sounded great until I realized that all of their massages are already 50% off and their prices are the \"lowest in town\". So, I wonder if that's even really a compensation, me thinks not! So, I was pretty much turned away as the receptionist told me he had his staff go on a break since there was no appointment in the books. He said he could try calling them to come back, since I was already there, and I could wait in the media room. I waited a grand total of 5 minutes and then realized it was a waste of my time. Again, I re-scheduled for 9\\/20. I called on the morning of 9\\/20 to confirm my appointment and was left recording a voicemail. When nobody returned my call after almost 2 hours, I called back and was greeted with the same male who took my previous appointment. When I called to ask what time my appointment was, he said there was no record of my appointment for that day. He told me it was scheduled for a date in October, which I knew was complete bogus!! At this point, I'm pretty peeved and ask the guy if he remembers me from the previous Friday, how I made the appointment with him IN PERSON...how do they not have it on record?!?! He doesn't even apologize but schedules me for the same day. I don't know if he's just the receptionist or the owner but really feel the business is suffering because of him.\n","\n","I get to the salon and as I walk in, the male receptionist says he now remembers me. I decide not to give a sly remark back and was left filling out paperwork. From this point on, I would love to give my experience 4 or 5 stars because my massage and facial were great!! The salon is really small and you can hear the chatter from the front of the salon into the massage room so that part wasn't super relaxing. Plus, it was a little warm in the room so that didn't help either. But, my massage therapist was very sweet and professional and gave a great massage! My facial was also very nice and probably the best part of my visit. This was my second time getting a facial ever in my life, the first one being nothing great, so I wasn't expecting much. If I had to come back to this salon, I would definitely return for a facial! I finished my appointment with the pedicure and was really disappointed with the lady who performed the pedicure. She took a couple breaks in between my pedicure (one to talk on the phone and the other to smoke). I was super relaxed at this point from my other services and didn't really care but thought that was unprofessional. The pedicure itself didn't even last 20 minutes...there was no foot or heal scrub and barely a massage...the best things about a pedicure!! I also didn't like the fact the pedicure stands are right when you walk into the salon, again not providing a lot of relaxation. The lady also talked to me about really weird things, including the fact that I had pretty feet and should get paid for people to kiss and hug them...ummm creepy!!\n","\n","I will say I am glad I used my Groupon and did enjoy the massage and facial. But, I really don't see myself ever stepping foot in here again, even with the 50% off card I recieved. I had trouble finding the place as well, just as a tip, it's right behind the Good Egg restaurant just off baseline and mill ave. Overall, most of the staff were unprofessional, place is very small and trouble with scheduling really put a bad taste in my mouth initially.\n","\n","I would stay far far away from here...\n","before Whoa, some of these reviews are mouth hanging open shocking to read! I've personally enjoyed every experience I've had here and will continue to return. Lunch time can be a bit crazy so just beware. Everything from the hummus, pitas and salads are delicious! I don't think I would call this place \"Mediterranean\" but it's good food. The tabouli salad I ordered today was gigantic and very tasty! All my co-workers who hadn't been before have loved it after a recommendation from myself. It can get a little pricey but to me isn't price difference wise to somewhere like Paradise Bakery. The food options are really good and I like that it's a healthier choice than some of the places around the area. I also love the Greek dressing they leave on the tables (which you can buy to take home as well). All in all, I am a fan and will keep returning!\n","before This place is a lot of fun for big groups or just to go with a few friends. The last time I was here, it was my birthday and boy do they celebrate birthdays! I got asked to the stage (with a few other people who also were celebrating a birthday) to be played and sing along...it was super fun! Just a heads up, if you plan to go on the weekends after 10pm, it's always super crowded and there's a cover charge. \n","\n","Buuuut, if you're looking for a fun (and a different) change of pace from the norm, this place is fun to visit. It's loud, entertaining and fun to sing along to the songs (that you know :)\n","before I often use Yelp to find great businesses and to review my experiences so when my husband and I wanted a pet door installed, we used JGM Pet Doors, based on their raving Yelp reviews. In OUR experience, we cannot in good faith give them a good review. Their quality, customer service and our overall experience were absolutely terrible. I've been waiting several MONTHS to write this review, as it took MONTHS for our experience to finally end with them. I've told my family and friends to NEVER use this company and they all were absolutely appalled when we shared with them our experience. \n","\n","We wanted a custom install and were quoted $500 and put down a deposit of $250. For the price, we expected great quality AND great customer service. I personally spoke with the owner, Greg, multiple times as the dog door we discussed and the install were both done poorly. After the first install visit, 2 days later, we found the dog door had fallen off. I called Greg multiple times and left messages to let him know this happened. When he finally returned my calls, he blamed it on our dog hitting it and knocking it off. First of all, we wanted to get the door BEFORE the dog so I told him we don't even have a dog so this wasn't possible. He never apologized about HIS company's crappy design or the fact that the door had been poorly installed. They come out again, a few weeks later and the design is poorly executed YET AGAIN. We were so disappointed with the quality that my husband and I both called Greg multiple times and left messages saying this wasn't the quality we had wanted and we wanted our deposit back. Greg finally returned our calls and said they would be out to get the door and refund our deposit. About a month later, we finally get someone out to get the door and refund our deposit.\n","\n","Greg, I hope you read this because you and your company need serious improvements. We were never rude or upset with you over the phone when we had to call you so many times, since it was so hard reaching you. Now, since our experience is over with your company, I hope you will learn from this experience, as my husband and I definitely have. You told us another company would never be able to provide what we wanted. Let me assure you that we have found that company and at a LOWER price with GREAT customer service!! I honestly don't know how you and your company have so many amazing reviews because this was probably the worst experience with a company and owner I've ever encountered.\n","before Really, I would give this place 3.5 stars because there were things about our experience that were 5 stars and then things that we about a 2-3 star. Location for me is great, literally a 2 min drive from my house. We walked in and I kid you not, there were 16 TV's plastered all over this place...a sports lovers heaven! Problem is they only had on 1 game. Service was very friendly and attentive, for me 5 stars. The wait time for food was a bit much (25 minutes for burgers) and the burgers for me weren't that good. I ordered my Avocado Burger to be Medium and it came out very well done. It was dry and I didn't end up eating it all. However, the macaroni and cheese was a slam dunk..5 stars! My boyfriend and I couldn't get enough of it! The burgers came with their branding \"HOB\" on top, which I thought was a cool touch. Beers were also ice cold and had a variety to choose from...another sports lovers dream! I would return but not order a burger.\n","before I think Over Easy is a very nice breakfast place. Yes, it is more expensive then Ihop and Denny's but the food is really good and has some unique options. I have had in my visits the Dolly breakfast sandwich (egg, tomato, bacon on a English muffin), brioche French toast (plain and Banana's Foster) and the chocolate chip pancakes. Service is also good and overall, it's a nice breakfast place.\n","before I've been twice and bought a great bag today! I got a Michael Kors satchel for under $100, including tax. The saleswoman was nice without being pushy. For those who haven't been, the bags they sell are either returns or display models from large chain department stores (Bloomingdales, Macy's, Lord and Taylor). Some have slight tears or blemishes but the bag I bought today has nothing wrong with it! Selection is really nice and I am really happy with my purchase. The ONLY thing I didn't respond well to was the fact that they have a computer and a reciept printer in store but my transaction was all done on a cell phone. I was also told my reciept would be texted to me and it never was. Other than that, I would totally recommend! Store is also located in a great shopping complex so go check it out if you haven't already!\n","before Pane Bianco came up as \"highly recommended\" for lunch on my Yelp app and is close to work so I decided to stop in for lunch and to try somewhere new. Parking was a bit tight and not a lot of spaces in general but was luckily able to snatch one. There are two sides to enter, one for to-go and one for eat in. I walked inside and the décor was so cute, very vintage meets farmhouse feel. They wanted to stick me at a long table with another party of 2 but felt awkward so I went to sit up at the bar, since there weren't any small tables to choose from. Service was very fast, ordered a diet coke but received a coca cola \"light\", which in my opinion does not taste like diet coke. Oh well. \n","\n","I read their menu (which is VERY limited) and looked on their board for the specials of the day. There were a total of 4 sandwiches, 4 salads and 2-3 \"bar size\" options to choose from and that's all. Only 2 of the options had meat in them so I was a bit disappointed with that and neither option was what I wanted. I ultimately ordered the market sandwich, which was a roasted tomato, arugula and goat cheese on focaccia bread. I think the servers were bored because it wasn't busy and they kept circling around waiting for something to do, very weird. Maybe I noticed it more because I was alone? Anyways, I got my food within 5 minutes and it came with a tiny serving of coleslaw, which was made with apples and red onions. The sandwich was fine but nothing amazing...coleslaw was different but ate it in like 3 bites. I was still hungry after my lunch so decided to order the flourless chocolate cake for dessert...couldn't pass that up! It was really great, came with a vanilla bean cream on top to balance out the richness of the cake. I got the bill and it was $22 so not cheap...the market sandwich with no meat on it was $12! Yikes. \n","\n","All in all, I just came to realize that Pane Bianco is just not for me. I know they have great ingredients and does have a certain appeal, very downtown. I did notice the dinner options and was curious if dinner time is a better time to go, since options were things I actually wanted to eat (stuffed peppers, posole, pasta, pizza). So, I wouldn't not recommend it I just don't think I would come back. Glad I tried it though!\n","before I've been to Benihana a couple times before but never to this location. I received my $30 off birthday coupon so we came in on a Thursday night. I actually have to use my birthday coupon early because it expires before my actual birthday! What a riot.. \n","\n","Service was slow but our server was very nice- our chef was really disappointing to be completely honest. You could barely understand him- he really wasn't a showman at all and couldn't cook the food well! The scallops were torched, meats were overcooked. The best thing I ate that night was the Rainbow Roll- which was very fresh! The white peach saki sangria was also tasty! We decided to leave before dessert (take it to go) because I ended up not feeling well half way through the night. \n","\n","Oh and on top of a $30 off coupon, we still didn't get out of there without spending close to $100. Medicore food for a very expensive price tag.\n","\n","I think I'm done with Benihana.\n","before The ambience of Kazmierz is cool, I like the fact that it's dark inside and looks like a basement wine cellar (with a bar and dance floor of course!) It is pretty laid back and loungy, so nothing like the crazy club scene some of Old Town Scottsdale has going on. I love coming here with friends to enjoy wine and appetizers. Every time I have been, we have had good service and have listened to good live music. I like bringing new people too because they always seem to enjoy it just as much as I do!\n","before Let me start off by saying my review is only to discuss Lunar Bingo nights, because I really haven't explored much else of the casino. Fort McDowell is easy to find (once you are on the 87N) with the big flashy signs for miles. This casino is smoky for sure but there are non-smoking rooms in the bingo lounge. The lounge is really large and has a little diner where you can order food, which actually isn't half bad. \n","\n","Lunar Bingo nights are really fun and start at midnight. I would suggest getting there around 10:30PM, because it can get really packed and not many seats are available if you come late. Also, it is pretty loud inside because DJ's come and play really loud (but great music!). For lunar bingo, prices are really cheap for games (around $9 a pack) and an extra $1-2 for the extra games. Drinks are also cheap ($2 beers). I usually try to come with a bunch of people because it really is a fun time. People walk around with glow sticks, because lunar bingo is with the lights off so it's fun to wear the glow sticks and play fun variations of bingo. Cash prizes are nice (anywhere from $200-$500) for payout\\/game. They also do a raffle.\n","\n","For lunar bingo, this place is fun and I have always enjoyed myself. Just walking through the casino, it's pretty basic and smoky. Overall, not the best I've been to but it works for what it is.\n","before I am a big fan of YC's! I love the wide variety of options for your bowl and the wonderful sauce options. I particularly like the soups, rice and chips with sweet and sour sauce!! I could eat bowl after bowl of those chips with sauce!!! I am literally getting hungry as I write this review...\n","\n","I didn't give YC's 5 stars for 2 reasons. 1 is that their prices keep going up. I swear everytime I go the price for a bowl has gone up. I think the last time I was there for dinner a bowl was $11.50. The other reason is that you have to pay for a to-go box!! I think that is a total rip off!!!\n","\n","Other than that, YC's is great and delicious. I would recommend for a filling lunch or dinner.\n","before I came here for dinner and HH with a friend, after hearing nothing but raving reviews about LGO! I actually drove past it the first time but was able to find it after a quick U-turn (legally of course!). The market is lovely with all kinds of things to look at, the bakery was stocked full of yummy goodies and breads galore! We were seated in the dining room and our waitress was very sweet and attentive. \n","\n","After looking at the menu's, we noticed there wasn't much of a HH (only 2 wines for $5, $1 off cocktails and $2 beers). My friend and I ordered Sangria (OK I had 2) and thought it was quite tasty and full of fruit to nibble on afterwards. We split the smoked salmon salad, which was amazing! Perfect amount to split with someone because we also ordered the roasted corn pizza. Wow, the pizza was so good! I didn't think corn in a pizza would taste this good but it really does, as it was layered underneath the cheese and sourdough pie! Since we saw all the amazing bakery items beforehand, we had to order the Smore's cupcake (to split!). It was also incredible and rich, glad we split it! \n","\n","I had a really great time and will be back! Delish!\n","before There are so many better breakfast options within a 5 mile radius of this place. For the price, the food is just not good and the restaurant is severely understaffed. A 30-45 minute breakfast visit took almost 2 hours due to the wait to be seated and a long time to get service to order. I will skip this place from now on.\n","before I'm a little shocked at some of the poor reviews of this place. I've gone twice with the first time being my boyfriend's birthday dinner and the second just a dinner out with friends. I would agree that the service here isn't stellar but nothing horrible enough to write\\/complain about on a review. \n","\n","Pro's: Great patio and indoor atmosphere, great tortillas (I've had the cheddar cheese and red pepper), good food\n","\n","Con's: Weak margaritas (for the price), limited indoor seating and limited menu\n","\n","Overall, I had a nice time both experiences and would recommend to others. I would like to go back when the weather is cooler so I can experience the patio.\n","before This place is off the chain!! We stopped here after hearing nothing but amazing things and were already there checking out the Miracle Mile shops. The line was a little long but worth the wait! I honestly don't think this place is ever dead because it's open 24 hours and has great food!\n","\n","I ordered the \"all american\" sandwich and the tomato bisque soup. My boyfriend ordered the chicken chipotle sandwich, which apparently is a limited time only sandwich. Priced fairly well for Vegas (around $6 a sandwich) and we both referred to the size of the sandwiches being like a brick. Both of us loved the portion and freshness of the sandwich, made to order, and I loved my soup! The soup has homemade croutons inside and the sandwich had all my favorites (turkey, lettuce, tomato, cheese) and also cranberries! It added a sweetness to the sandwich but very good toasted with the other ingredients. My boyfriend's sandwich was also good, the chipotle sauce giving the chicken a nice flavor. \n","\n","I'm a little sad I won't be able to find one of these back home in AZ but am hopeful for the day it makes it here! Definitely check this place out when you're hungry and in Vegas baby!\n","before A friend and I came here for lunch, as it's pretty close to both of our jobs. I really like the church conversion of this restaurant- there's a lot to look at and see visually. We did come right at lunch so there was a slight wait but we were seated in the \"quieter room\" as the bigger room does echo and can be noisy. Our waitress was really attentive and serve was great overall. Chips and salsa were wonderful, I liked that was a mild salsa and other options to spice it up. I ordered the chicken enchiladas, my friend ordered the taco plate and corn. I personally thought the tacos were pretty expensive but they looked great! My chicken enchilada plate came with 2 enchiladas, rice and black beans. Food was great!! \n","\n","I will definitely be back- probably would like to try again for HH or dinner.\n","before I've eaten at some Middle Eastern type deli's and bakeries before and this one does not disappoint! Nestled in between Thomas and Osborn off 16th street, turn in the small parking lot with lots of painted colors on the store front windows. The store was fun to look around, definitely won't find these items at your local Fry's. I walked up to the counter to order and was greeted by a smiling man. I ordered a small hummus with wheat pita, the chicken gyro pita sandwich and a lemonade. I didn't feel like eating a huge plate of food for lunch..maybe next time? Seating is a little tight and not many tables for small parties. I was lucky to snag a small table near the dessert case and waited about 10 minutes for food to arrive. Hummus was good but obviously came right out of the fridge. Pita was good, just wished it would have been warmed up. The sandwich was also good and the yogurt sauce inside was amazing! Apparently you only get a side of it when you order a plate, not a sandwich...bummer! The hyped up lemonade is nice and sweet. As I was getting up to leave, the owner came up to me and asked if I'd like a refill on my drink. Of course! He knew exactly what I had too...very nice! I wish they had other desserts though, since I do not like baklava and that was the majority of what they had. However, I will definitely return!\n","before Lovely neighborhood, good parking, retro vibe.\n","\n","The employee working was very friendly and let me try a couple samples. They had some obscure flavors and some normal ones. I was told all the ice cream was made on property. I went with the Smores Sundae, which was 2-3 scoops of chocolate ice cream, graham crackers, hot fudge and marshmallow fluff, which they actually take a blow torch to resemble a cooked marshmallow! The sundae itself was huge, I could have (and should have) split it with someone else. It was $8.15 though, which to me is really expensive for a sundae! \n","\n","I would definitely come back- maybe skip the sundae and try a cone instead!\n","before This is definitely NOT a smokehouse or BBQ joint I would ever recommend to anyone. It's a weird concept because they also have fair food too (funnel cakes, corn dogs, etc.) There were 4 in our party that came in on a Saturday night- it was pretty dead inside whereas all the restaurants in the surrounding areas had waits\\/lines out the door. There's a large smoker and BBQ pit in the middle of the restaurant and there was NOTHING going on in this area! I was scared the food had already been made and we were just going to get stuff warmed up. \n","\n","Our waitress was completely clueless- whenever we asked her a question she had to bring other servers and even the bartender over to answer anything. We weren't asking anything crazy- just if they could make a Mai Tai. Even though they have a \"full bar\", 3 of the drinks requested couldn't be made because they didn't carry that specific liquor. My friend finally decides to order a shot of Jack and said the alcohol seemed \"watered down\". \n","\n","Food arrives and parts of mine were cold (mac and cheese and the meats were barely warmed). I went with the 2 meat (chicken and pulled pork). During our meal, our waitress takes away the BBQ sauces to \"refill them\", even though they were more than half way full. I hardly ate my food because everything tasted re-heated and awful!! \n","\n","Stay far fary away from here!\n","before I came in for lunch, just before the lunch rush. I was seated right away and my waiter was great! I decided on a personal size margherita pizza. It took about 15 minutes but was surprised by how small it was! I ate it in 3 minutes. If you're not super hungry, it's perfect but I was still hungry when I left! I have had other items on the menu before, I would highly recommend their stuffed mushrooms!! \n","\n","Great pizza, clean restaurant, nice service. What more could I want?!\n","before Out of all the places I've ever attended a conference, this one is top notch! Facility is nice and clean, staff is friendly and the food\\/beverage supply is endless! The food is really awesome (they feed you every 2 hours) and I always get my fill when I come here. Conference rooms\\/space are very spacious and nice. My only complaint would be the location...it's not exactly easy to find but is in a nice business complex. Overall, this place rocks!\n","before This place is really close to my boyfriend's house so we decided to stop here one night to satisfy our sweet tooth cravings. We were the only customers inside at the time but was impressed with how many choices they have as well as their beverage selection. We had a few samples, all fantastic! I honestly can't remember what I ordered but remember it being delicious! They have a lot of sorbets and fruit flavors too if that's more your style. Girls behind the counter were helpful and gave suggestions for flavor combinations. Oh and the place smells wonderful!! The waffle cone pieces they give you in your gelato are good too!\n","\n","Will come back!!\n","before If you're looking for a cute-sy place to try at a great location on the Strip (in front of Caesar's Palace) this place should make your list. Yes it's expensive and probably overpriced but what place on the Strip isn't? The wait is pretty crazy but, I did get a kick ass table outside on the patio with an amazing view and great service! The frozen hot chocolate was amazing, lets be honest, but I couldn't come close to finishing it because the drink is so huge! My friend and I had a fun time chatting, enjoying our beverage\\/dessert and being on the strip. I would come back for sure!!\n","before I booked an appointment after receiving a gifted massage from my sister. Amber did a great job with my massage- I felt so relaxed and she accommodated the pressure to what I needed and wanted. I did end up signing up for a year membership so I am excited to start getting massages more often!\n","before I've spent money here twice; once on a take out order and once inside. Service is slow but you get your food...eventually. I'm a huge Italian food fan, especially when they have chicken parm on the menu. At Frankie's, I've ordered the chicken parmigiana sandwich and the chicken parmigiana meal. Both were absolutely awful!! The sandwich bread was so toasted it crumbled apart and the chicken inside was pathetic with 3 very thin cut strips with a tiny amount of sauce and cheese. Thank God you get a side of marinara because you need the sauce of it to get this down.  The chicken parm meal was also disappointing- the spaghetti is grossly overcooked and the marinara has no flavor. I will say the chocolate mousse cake was delicious but I doubt it's made in house. \n","\n","I'm sad because Frankie's is pretty close to my house and I really want to like it. It's just not good. Sorry.\n","before I've been going to Paulenes for years to get pedicures. Depending on the day and time, this place can get pretty packed. If you go on a weekday during the middle of the day, I've found the experience to be wonderful with a longer massage. The ladies are friendly and do a good job. I really love the hot stones they rub on your legs with the lotion. \n","\n","If you're looking for a clean, professional place to get a pedicure, I would recommend this place. The prices are a tad high but is nice to spoil yourself every once in a while. For a regular pedicure, callus removal and tip, I usually pay around $25. I've never had a terrible experience there and do come with friends often.\n","before I am a huge fan of Schlotzsky's sandwiches but the price and caloric intake are a bit much to take in on a frequent basis. I have been to this location several times because it is close to my job but have experienced mixed emotions with the staff. Some are extremely friendly (like the lady who calls out your sandwich order) and some are a little rude. The older man who works there, which I am now assuming is the owner based on other reviews, is a little harsh and likes to make jokes at your expense. Yesterday, I ordered a cookie to go with my meal and told me to get 3 because it's a better deal. I caved because I do love cookies and a good deal and he joked I would have to eat them all before I could leave. I laughed and said \"no problem\"! So, he was nicer to me yesterday but has been rude on other days. Meh, no biggie. All in all, this place is not bad to go and the food is tasty.\n","before Yogurtland is my favorite frozen yogurt place. They always have great yogurt choices and they have the best toppings! I love coming here for a nice treat. Their bowls are big and you can take whatever you don't eat home. I usually scarf mine but that's because I love yogurt!!\n","\n","The only negative is the parking can be limited depending on the time of day you go. Other than that, it's a nice place with great yogurt. I even like their water with the strawberries, which is complimentary. Expect to pay around $5-$10 for yogurt, depending on how much you put in your bowl. Not really cheap but definitely delicious!\n","before I've been coming here for years and it is definitely the best bagel shop in town!! They have a wide variety of bagels, cream cheese and sandwiches that are all delicious! I would personally recommend the egg and oreo bagels. Staff is friendly and prices are reasonable. They also have really good lemonade :)\n","\n","Overall, if you're in the area or looking for a nice bagel\\/sandwich shop, check this place out!! Oh, and they offer a lot of coupons and specials on their Facebook page so be sure to check for those too!\n","before Huge transformation!! I remember the Pavilions movies theatre growing up as a staple place to go for movies. Once the economy went downhil, so did this theatre..until now!I've been twice since they re-opened. I went to see a G rated movie and an R rated movie. In the G movie, we took some time to visit the bar beforehand and grab a drink. For the R movie, we had someone give us a menu and come to us in the theatre to grab our drink and food order. I couldn't believe I could have a glass of wine and watch a movie in a theatre! I was in heaven!\n","\n","The seats and theatre itself were very comfortable and clean. I loved both experiences here and will be returning! I wasn't bothered by the prices for the movie since movie tickets nowadays are ridiculous. I'd rather pay the same or a little more for an experience like this than go to a regular theatre. Well worth it!!\n","before I came here with a few friends about a week ago for dinner. I ordered the egg drop soup and broccoli with chicken. Overall, it was good but not great. The egg drop soup was extremely hot, even 20 minutes after I got it, but was ok tasting. The broccoli and chicken was good just had too much sauce for my taste. \n","\n","I'd probably have lunch here next time instead of dinner.\n","before I'm absolutely obsessed with Snooze and cannot wait for their Gilbert location to open! The décor reminds me of retro modern and the servers here are fun with great personalities! My party decided to order and share so I was able to try multiple things on the menu. Their flight of pancakes is a great deal- we got the pear, pineapple and blueberry streusel. All of them are great but the pear was my favorite! The brioche French toast is outstanding as well. The benedicts are great too because you can order both the same or 2 different ones. I went with the ham and chilaquiles and I loved the chilaquiles one! Hash browns are also great! \n","\n","I really don't have a negative thing to say about this place. As a tip, they do get very busy so call ahead or be OK with a wait.\n","\n","Can't wait to eat here again!\n","before I recently moved to the area and have been on the hunt for a good bagel shop\\/bakery. I have been here twice now and haven't been impressed either time. The first time I went inside, which was nice. I ordered the cinnamon bagel with honey walnut cream cheese. I must say, that cream cheese is divine!! The blueberry muffin was a joke...really greasy and not tasty. I came here again for breakfast and went to the drive thru, which was really fast and efficient. I just kept it simple with a plain bagel and plain cream cheese and didn't have any complaints. All in all, this place is OK but nothing special. I really wish they had more bakery items to choose from since their restaurant has the word \"bakery\" in it.\n","before I've been meaning to check out TopGolf since it opened and finally had a chance to go. I went with a group on a Monday night, since weekends can get pretty busy. We got our membership cards and were directed to our bay. Food and drinks were all delicious, we had the fish bowl (says to share with 4 people) and I tried the chicken and waffle sliders. Even though I didn't hit the ball farther than the green section, I still had a blast! It was a very expensive night though so not a place we can go often unfortunately! Definitely check this place out whether you are a pro or a beginner!\n","before This place has changed names so many times but this was the most \"updated\" name of the venue I could find. It's current name is Ak-Chin Pavilion. Anyways, I came here for the first time to see Gavin DeGraw\\/The Script\\/Train last night. I read all the horrible reviews and was a little nervous coming here. We came about an hour before the concert and had no problem with finding the place, parking, getting in or finding a place on the lawn to sit. In my opinion, drinking a beer and being on the lawn was a really wonderful way to enjoy a summer night. The sound and stage set ups for all the bands were really great and thought they put on a great show! The only downside for me was the fact that everything was extremely overpriced. I paid $12 for a beer and water was a whopping $7.50! I would suggest bringing your own water and eating beforehand. The marijuana smoking on the lawn was also a small issue so if you are sensitive to that, beware. Overall, had a great time and would definitely return!\n","before I have waited a long time for Panera to make it out to Phoenix and I'm less then impressed so far. Parking is awful during the lunch rush. I came in, ordered, paid $13 for a half sandwich, soup and large drink. Pastries are $.99 extra. Pepsi products only with a few tea options. My food took almost 20 minutes to get, thank goodness I get an hour for lunch! Seating spaces are awkward unless you get a booth. I would rather get the cookie instead of the roll with my meal, which I didn't even eat. My turkey avocado BLT on sourdough was good, as well as my fuji apple chicken salad. Food runners were constantly confused of where orders were going and was asked several times if random orders were mine. I know they just opened but they certainly have a lot of kinks to work out before I come back.\n","before I love a good dive bar but this place is disgusting! I was with a group of 7 looking for a bite to eat on a Saturday evening before making the long drive to Glendale for a pre-season Cards game. We walked in and the place was dead...nobody was in the dining area and a few people were sitting around the bar drinking. Inside it was dark, dingy and felt dirty. While waiting for service, I noticed a small stage and a few games to play but nobody was even around this area. We waited a solid 10 minutes and were never greeted nor did anyone come to take our drink\\/food order. Since we were in a hurry, we decided to leave. One of the people in my party yelled as we were walking out \"You just lost about $300 in business by not even acknowledging us!\". True fact. I won't be back.\n","before This place is pretty dang cool! It's right off Scottsdale Road (just before Oak). Part grocery store, part restaurant, part deli, this place has a lot to offer. I've eaten here a couple times and have enjoyed the food. They have Italian classics to sandwiches (and desserts!). So yummy!! The only criticism I have is that it is really small inside. I feel squished trying to pass through people in the aisles and the seating to eat is pretty tight too. Other than that, it's fantastico!\n","before My husband and I had a gift card and decided to come here for his birthday. This was our first time coming to Melting Pot. The first thing I noticed is how underwhelming the decor inside the restaurant is- for such an expensive experience, you would think the ambiance would be modern. Our waiter was nice and attentive- we also got our picture taken but never saw it at the end of the night. Our waiter explained the cooking process and options on the menu, including drinks. We went with the 4 course option and stated with the fontina cheese fondue. Neither my husband or I liked it- it's a very pungent flavor. One thing we learned quickly is if you want something cooked, it needs to be at the very bottom of the pot (raw veggies served in the first course don't taste good with hot cheese in my opinion). Anyways, next were salads, which we LOVED. I ordered the California and he ordered the Apple Bacon. I literally want to make the raspberry vinaigrette dressing at home because it was THAT good! Next was the meat course- I went with the pacific rim (pot-stickers, duck, sirloin and shrimp)- hubby had the land and sea (filet, shrimp, and chicken). We went with the mojo sauce to cook the meat and it provided some flavor but not a lot. We ended up adding other flavors in the pot to make the flavors pop. The sauces they provide on the side are very good, especially the greek goddess sauce for the mushrooms- stuff them after they cook and they are amazing! \n","\n","Take away from this dining experience- I know it's supposed to be an \"experience\" cooking your food but when you only get 2 skewers at a time, it takes FOREVER to get through all the meat and veggies they give you on the side to cook. The potatoes were in the pot from the beginning of the meat cooking process and they never really cooked all the way through- why potatoes? By the time we finished dinner, we were exhausted and hot (the cooking pot being in front of you for 2+ hours makes the space a little toasty). \n","\n","For dessert, we went with the smores fondue, which was the best thing we ate all night. It came with brownies, strawberries, pineapple, banana, shortcake and rice krispies. It was also nice because it came on a happy birthday plate and we sang to my husband for his birthday. We also had a coupon for chocolate covered strawberries and received a box at the end of dinner (call ahead for those though). And, if you check in on Yelp, you get a free bottle of the garlic and wine seasoning. \n","\n","I can't say the service or food wasn't great because it was and I have no complaints there. My husband and I both agreed we just didn't enjoy the 2.5 hour dinner experience enough to come back. We also thought it was really expensive ($125 for 2 people). I'm glad we tried this but I don't know if we would really want to come back.\n","before On a rare rainy day, I entered the restaurant craving some soup and a sandwich. I could have gone through the drive thru but since this was my first time, I wanted to go inside and get the full experience. At the entrance, cute home décor items were displayed for sale. A fire was roaring in the middle of the restaurant and felt very cozy inside. Before ordering, the pastry display is right there with all these beautiful desserts staring at you screaming \"eat me!\". Oh I will, don't you worry!\n","\n","There wasn't a line when I came in but then again it was around 3:30pm on a rainy day. Samples of their bread were available on the counter, in which I grabbed a slice of the asiago cheese bread. So good! I then asked the cashier for recommendations and he said the turkey, bacon and avocado sandwich was the best seller. I ordered it as a whole sandwich, a cup of corn chowder and a couple desserts (a mint chocolate brownie and a chocolate mousse dessert). All this and a beverage for $15, not pricey at all. If we are comparing it to paradise bakery, as many of the other reviews do, this is WAY cheaper! \n","\n","I wait a few minutes for my food to-go and continued to look around at the items for sale. I waited maybe 5 minutes and everything was ready to go. The sandwich was HUGE and looked so yummy. I couldn't wait to get home and eat. When I got home, I zapped the soup for 30 seconds just to heat it up again. The corn chowder was very good, it had sweet corn which gave it a sweet yet savory flavor. The sandwich was amazing...the focaccia bread was so soft and amazing! The sandwich contents kept falling out but still a great sandwich and was very filling. I actually had to wait many hours before trying the desserts. \n","\n","The mint chocolate brownie was incredible! I also got the chocolate mousse dessert, which was good but not as good as the brownie. They have lots of other desserts to choose from as well and am excited to come back and try more!\n","\n","I have absolutely nothing bad to say about Kneader's. I am so excited this is not too far away from me and cheaper than other bakeries. I can't say this place really compares to Paradise Bakery anyways, the food and variety of desserts and concept are very different. Would totally recommend and will be back!!\n","before I remember this place as Jimmy Woo's (I'm still a little sad it's gone) but Morning Squeeze was a nice stop end stop for the Yelp Shopping Crawl for Local Businesses. We were served a breakfast buffet and received 2 drink coupons, with a choice of a Mimosa or a Bloody Mary. Same layout as before just different color scheme to Jimmy's, there's 2 bars (one outdoors and one indoors, outdoor patio seating and indoor seating). Kitchen is open and booths surround the restaurant with varying tables. Food and everything was OK, drinks were nice, atmosphere was probably my favorite. I would return if I was in the area and looking for a breakfast\\/brunch hangout spot in Old Town!\n","before As far as bowling alleys go, it's a pretty average looking place. They do have a pretty cool cafe with pool tables and TV's as well as a snack bar. What I do like about this place is it's clean and staff are very friendly. I come here for my boyfriend's bowling league and find it comfortable to hang out.I also do enjoy the fact there's no smoking inside. If you're looking for a good place to bowl, I'd go here!\n","before We came here for dinner on a Sunday night, after participating in San Tan's Brews Cruise event. We were seated in the \"extra\" dining room surrounded by brick walls and a TV. There were 6 in our party and seating was pretty tight. Service was prompt but I was a little disappointed they brought out all the food together, rather than appetizer first then salad then pizza. Everything we ate was good but nothing I ate was \"wow\". I would recommend the pizza, we got the roma basil and great white. This place is great though for watching a game and hanging out in a sports bar. All in all was good just not great.\n","before Is the best bagel place I've been to? No. I came here for a \"to go\" breakfast with my man. As we were waiting for our food, he whispered to me \"this place is filthy\". The vent above the bagel rack was so dusty! The counters, floors and tables looked like they hadn't been wiped down either. We had already paid so we just decided to get our food and go. The guy who helped us was very sweet but incredibly slow. We spent almost 20 minutes waiting for 2 bagel sandwiches and a chocolate chip muffin. The bagel sandwiches tasted good (I tried a tomato basil bagel) and liked it. I also thought the variety in bagels was nice. The muffin wasn't my favorite but was edible. Prices were reasonable but nothing great. Just like my review says, A-OK.\n","before I work around the corner and go here sometimes for a quick lunch. I've never had a problem here until today. I walk in, order my flat bread, sit down and BAM! In my sandwich is a HUGE grasshopper just jammed in there with the head popping out! I didn't freak out outwardly just calmly walked over to the cashier and showed her my sandwich. She joked that it's just a \"little extra protein\" but would make me a new sandwich. News flash...this is AMERICA, nobody wants to eat that kind of \"protein\" at Subway! My stomach is still hurting from the sight and for my trouble was offered \"2 free cookies\". Great, thanks. All in all, I will never come back and probably would never eat at Subway again!\n","before I LOVE cornish pasty!! The ambience is really neat but the place itself is a little small. Everytime I go, I try a new pasty and every one I have tried, I have liked. Good selection of beers (import and domestic). I personally like sitting up at the bar because staff is really friendly and chatty (if you want them to be).\n","\n","If you're looking for a new place to try that's casual, this place is great!\n","before I was introduced to MPRC in lieu of my company's annual Christmas party. Location is tucked aside a mountain with a view of the city but not exactly in the best of surrounding neighborhoods. We were here during the day so we didn't get those twinkling night time views, which I can imagine are just fabulous! The reception space is outdated but large, especially the outside patio. Buffet food was chicken, prime rib, pasta salad, salad, veggies, mashed potatoes and a roll. The food was fine, just your average banquet hall food. I think for this occasion, the space worked but thinking of it as a reception for a wedding, I wouldn't even go there unless you don't care what your reception space looks like and\\/or are on a tight budget. There's really nothing special about the space except for the views. Next!\n","before Out of all the popular fro-yo places, Yogurtland is surely the best! I have never had a bad experience and come here often. The flavors are diverse and delicious! I personally go for any chocolate, graham cracker, pistachio or any flavors in that family. The toppings bar is also really fresh and always stocked with plenty of goodies! You can get anything from fresh fruit to candy to cereal to sauce. The staff is also very friendly and sample cups are always available upon arrival. Prices are reasonable unless you fill up your cup with a lot (like myself). For two normal size cups, my boyfriend and I usually spend around $10. Great location, right off the 202 inside a complex with In and Out and Starbucks. Overall, this place is amazing and I will keep coming back!\n","before After trying Binkley's, I wanted to try out their casual Cafe Bink. I've been here twice now and have had exceptional experiences both times. Service is attentive and prompt. Dylan W. was our server both times. He was great and would recommend! The food here is straightforward but made with exceptional ingredients. The last time I was here, I ordered the fries (which are awesome), a burger and a caesar salad. Everything was great! Fries came with a trio of sauces, including a garlic aioli and truffle ketchup. Caesar is made with homemade croutons and anchovies. I didn't think I liked anchovies but in the salad, they taste great. The burger was well made and delicious on the onion roll. For dessert, we tried the nutella creme brule, which was outstanding! It also came with chocolate chip cookies on the side. Yumm-o!! \n","\n","It's a bit of a drive if you aren't already in North Scottsdale, Carefree or Cave Creek but well worth it! It's small inside, has a nice bar and a beautiful patio that has a great view of the mountains and desert scene. Prices are a bit high but food is great!\n","\n","Will keep returning!\n","before I've been eating at Casella's for years!! I used to live down the street and go more often then I do now but even when I'm in the area, I try and stop by. The decor is old but if you look past that, you will discover the family friendliness and food are incredible! I usually order the turkey sub but their chicken salad sub is THE BEST! Unfortunately, this place isn't super healthy but boy is it tasty!\n","\n","Just remember to bring cash because they don't accept anything else!!\n","before I came here for lunch...service line is in the back so you have to walk around the dining area or cut people off in line to \"start\". I had to re-direct a couple people who came in after me. Service was also really slow and the meat slicer was spitting out meat across the counter. Then, while one of the staff was making my sandwich, there was a disgusting guy who literally came in, cut me off in line, proceeded to the cash register and demanded change for the bus (mind you he didn't order food but would \"think about it\"). Staff didn't say anything since he wasn't ordering a sandwich...rude much?! I get to the cash register and she asked if I wanted to leave a tip...for what?! Crappy service, rude patrons and mediocre food? No thanks! Needless to say, I won't be back.\n","before If you're craving Chinese (or good food for that matter), check out Desert Jade. I came here on my lunch hour. Service was attentive and food came out really fast. The crowd starting really coming in at noon so I just missed it by coming in a little after 11AM. I ordered the lunch portion of the chicken broccoli, which also came with a scoop or rice and an egg roll. Hot tea is also available at each table. I really enjoyed the food and my experience. I will be back!\n","before As a big fan of Julio G's, I was hoping this place would be just as amazing. Unfortunately, I was completely disappointed. \n","\n","My friends and I decided to check this place out for dinner. On a Saturday night, this place was completely dead. That should have been my first clue to get out of there. We went in and the decor was the exact same as Julio's, which I thought was odd. Somehow, service took forever, even though it was really slow. I literally had to walk up to the bar to get a refill on my drink because nobody bothered to come by and check on us while we waited over 30 minutes for our food.\n","\n","I ordered the chicken tacos, which were completely disgusting. I sent them back (I never send food back) but I literally could not  stomach the food. I re-ordered chicken tacos with basic chicken, lettuce, tomatoes and sour cream. They were better than what I had orginally ordered but tasted similar to what I could make at home. One of my friends ordered the enchiladas with enchilada sauce and I literally wanted to throw up after tasting them. Our waiter and the manager were both extremely apologetic but I knew I would never be eating here again.\n","\n","If you're looking for a good meal or authenic mexican, this place is definitely not it.\n","before I really wish I could give this place a better review, since I see it has many raving reviews, but I just didn't have that great of an experience. I love trying new places and I especially love a good sandwich so I purchased a Groupon for lunch and decided since it was close by, I'd check it out. I liked that it was in downtown Mesa and had a cute concept with the whole picnic theme so I was looking forrward to something a little different. Parking is pretty limited, I got a spot on the side of the building but there wasn't a whole lot of other places to park other than the street.\n","\n","It wasn't very busy during the lunch rush but I still waited about 20 minutes to get my food. I only ordered the caprese sandwich and a fruit cup so I was surprised it took as long as it did since they aren't actually cooking anything I ordered, just putting it together. Then, when I saw the size of my fruit cup, my jaw dropped open. It was literally the size of a cup you put ketchup or another condiment inside. I think total there were two pieces of strawberry and a few grapes. Sorry but if I didn't have a Groupon, I would have went up to the counter and asked for my money back on that alone! Then, when I tasted the sandwich, it really wasn't anything special.\n","\n","I remember leaving disappointed and didn't feel like it was a good value at all. I also felt like the menu is pretty limited and there really wasn't a lot on there I would be interested in eating (and I am by no means a picky eater). Overall, not a place I enjoyed.\n","before I came in on a weekday, when it wasn't busy, to avoid the insane wait times mentioned in previous reviews. I personally felt overwhelmed by the menu choices so I went with a pre made creation, the chocolate combustion. The guy at the counter explained the menu but it was kinda loud and couldn't really hear him. He tells me my total...$9.66! Say what?!?! \n","\n","Anyways, I wait a few minutes and got my order. I felt like the chocolate ice cream tasted like a Wendy's frosty, just a different texture of course. Everything else in it was so crunchy. Maybe I just didn't appreciate the new age concept of ice cream made with liquid nitrogen because of how insanely expensive it was. I'm glad I gave it a try though!\n","before Their food is really good. However, everything is over-priced and the place is an absolute dump. I also question the cleanliness of this place.\n","before I absolutely love Cave Creek and when I get the chance to drive up there, I love to explore it's unique places. I love all the places to shop and eat and the Horny Toad is no exception there. The name captured my attention and we pulled into the dirt lot and parked. 2 adorable stores are also on property next to the restaurant. Prepare to step back into the Wild West days with the wood panels, floors and funky décor. A friend and I came for lunch and the patio was crowded so we sat inside. Service here was very good and quick! You can smell BBQ throughout the entire restaurant so the pulled pork sandwich was calling my name! We got our food within 10 minutes. Here's where things went south...the BBQ was very average. Coleslaw was OK. I didn't finish my plate. I do hear the fried chicken is what's popular but of course didn't know that until after I had already eaten. Bummer.\n","\n","If you're looking for a unique experience in a great little town, go here. If you're looking for amazing food, go somewhere else.\n","before I used to live in the area (now I moved by the one in Gilbert) but came here a few times for grub. Just a heads up, their menu online is not updated with what they have in store. I let the manager know the last time I was inside but am not sure if it's been updated. So, I have ordered the turkey and avocado croissant, Italian sub and a wrap. Both tasted good but it is expensive in my opinion for what you get. I've never been in when it's busy (even during lunch time) so that weirds me out too. Their chip selection is also limiting...they didn't even have regular plain chips! Oh well, this place is sufficient for a sub bite but can't say it's amazing.\n","before To celebrate our anniversary, my boyfriend and I decided to go somewhere nice for dinner. We made a reservation and were seated as soon as we arrived. The booth they gave us was very spacious. Our server was very attentive and we continued to recieve great service throughout our dining experience. We were there about two hours so it's definitely a \"dining experience\". \n","\n","For an appetizer, we had to try this table side mozzarella because we kept hearing such amazing things! The server who made it was really friendly and showed us \"newbies\" what it was all about. We got to choose what kind of salt we wanted and if we wanted oil. We chose the Hawaiian salts, which were great! I would definitely say the mozzarella was the hit of the night for us! For dinner, I ordered the swordfish and my boyfriend ordered the short rib. Both were very delicious and would recommend! We took the chocolate cake with raspberry sauce home with us to share. The cake was very rich but good! Overall, I would recommend Tanzy. For us, it was definitely an indulgence (food and money wise) but we enjoyed out time at the restaurant.\n","before This place is pretty legit. They have delicious and unique flavors that are good to enjoy alone or blended with another flavor. The prices are pretty reasonable as well. I would recommend this place for sure!\n","before My goodness this place is good! I've been several times and have enjoyed my cupcakes each time. My sister and her husband ordered their wedding cake from here and enjoyed their overall cake design and taste. Not a ton of flavors for cupcakes but they are better known for their cakes. My favorite is the cookies and cream cupcake. Plus their sandwich board on cooper is great, check out if you like cupcakes!\n","before I have been waiting YEARS for Cheddar's to make it's way to Arizona. I honestly didn't think it would ever happen but now that it's here, I'm in HEAVEN!! \n","\n","This location is prime, just on the other side of the 101 to Chandler Mall. Restaurant is extremely clean and looks amazing. You would think from the inside this is a fancy restaurant until you read the prices and think \"YES, good food that's actually affordable!\" Since this is a new restaurant, expect to wait unless of course you come at like 9:30PM on a weeknight. Service was friendly and efficient, even though it was busy when we came. We ordered an appetizer of chips and queso (adding meat is FREE). Delicious! I ordered the Chicken Caesar  pasta salad, which has been my go-to dish at Cheddar's ever since I've known about it. I think my favorite part of the meal is the unbelievably soft and buttery croissant that comes with the meal. I could eat an entire tray of those things. In fact, during this visit, I had 3 and they only charged me for 2. We didn't get dessert- too full honestly. My boyfriend had a few drinks as well and walked out of there for $40. \n","\n","Great value, food and service. I will keep coming back!!!\n","before I came in on a weekday basically just to alleviate my curiosity and to maybe get some ideas for furniture to fill up my brand new home. I walked into the showroom and was immediately \"hunted down\". The guy who helped me was very nice but was obviously trying to get a sale. I told him multiple times I was just looking but he proceeded to follow me around and collect my information. I did see some very nice things but way out of my budget! I was hoping prices were a little more reasonable, as this store is new to Arizona, but we're talking thousands of dollars for a couple sofas. The salesman told me these stores are super well known in Texas and throughout the South and apparently \"the best there is\". I walked through the dining table area and did like a couple tables. When I asked if anything came in black, the salesman ran around trying to \"get some answers\" but found out that nothing comes in black. I am surprised that a furniture store of this \"quality\" has no dining tables in black! When I asked about the financing options, I also wasn't impressed by what I heard. Many competitors are offering no interest for 60 months...they don't. For the \"quality\", I just can't fathom spending this much money on something that isn't super high end or more well known.\n","before I would never come back and I would never recommend this salon to anyone!! My sister and I went in for mani's and Pedi's on my birthday and somehow it took almost 3 hours for us to get both done! The day we went they were not busy, there were only 4 technicians working so we ended up having to wait about 30 minutes with our feet in cold water before our pedicures began. Both of our technicians were nice but not good at what they do. My gel manicure started peeling off in a few days and my pedicure looked terrible that I ended up going to another salon a week later to get another one because I couldn't stand looking at the terrible pedicure any longer! I wish I would have went to another salon but now I know to avoid this place like the plague...\n","before I fell in love with Culver's when I went in Wisconsin back in 2007. At the time, I had only tried the custard, which is absolutely divine! I went there a few times until I had to return home to Arizona. After a few years of patiently waiting, I found out Culver's was coming to Mesa! I was elated!!! Since then, I have expanded my pallete to their burgers, wraps and sides. I still think the custard is what makes this place special but their other food is good too. I love the fact that they have flavor of the day for custards. Totally amazing place and I would recommend to anyone who likes burgers, fries and custard.\n","before I'm always looking for a new spot to try and this place is about a mile from my house. We came in during happy hour and the place was pretty dead. Our server was nice and very attentive, but can tell he was bored with his lack of tables because he came over every 5 minutes. Food choices are American (burgers, salads, sandwiches). We ordered beers, which were $5 for craft beer pints. Beer choices here are good. For HH prices though, I wasn't too impressed. Appetizers are still between $5-10.\n","\n","For dinner, I ordered the Wrangler burger and fries. I was told to stay far away from the coleslaw, as recommended by our server. My boyfriend ordered the philly cheesesteak and fries. Food arrived and mine tasted fine. My boyfriend said his philly was very dry and the bread was clearly burnt. He couldn't wait to leave. I can't say my burger was bad because it wasn't. I liked the egg bun too. Fries were not warm though and that was a bummer.\n","\n","We didn't get dessert, just the check. We left for about $30. Sorry TapHouse but we won't be back. Nothing special here\n","before I think this place might be better to actually dine in but our first experience was take out. Restaurant is very small but it appears they provide spice options for dine in that they don't for take out. Anyways, I ordered the Mr. Thai Fried Rice and my fiancé ordered the garlic beef with sticky rice. $25 for both. I get home after picking up and the sticky rice was clumped together inside a Ziploc bag- weird. The portion on the fried rice was good except there were only 2 pieces of shrimp (which you pay $2 extra for) so that was a disappointment. The garlic beef was OK. Fried rice lacked flavor so I ended up adding soy sauce we had at home to bring some flavor to the dish. Overall, the food wasn't all that great for take out. I would be hesitant to try this place again.\n","before I just want to shout out to Kristen M. at the corporate office, who contacted me after this review. She not only apologized but gave me another opportunity to try this location. I went on a week night and just ordered dessert. The pizooki was amazing and I was SO happy to have indulged in such heaven! THANK YOU Oregano's for your amazing customer service...much appreciated. Will be back for sure!!\n","before Wow! I've always wanted to try Pearl and I finally got my chance! My boyfriend and I went in on a Saturday night around 8PM and it wasn't super busy. Our waitress was very attentive and received excellent service throughout the night. Food came out quickly and looked delicious. We ordered pot stickers to start ($6) and were good. For the rolls, we ordered a Philly Roll, Vegas Roll, El Diablo Roll and Caterpillar Roll. All of them were delicious! I loved how fresh everything tasted and I loved that the Philly Roll came with avocado inside! My boyfriend could not stop raving about the El Diablo, which came with ceviche on top as well as 2 tacos and a shot of tequila ($1 extra). This one is for the spicy lovers though, which I am not. Most of their specialty rolls are spicy as well. \n","\n","The prices are higher than other sushi restaurants but definitely worth it for the quality! It won't be somewhere I can go often but definitely somewhere I will know to go again!\n","before We had a gift card- went in around noon on a Sunday. If you don't want to wait, I would suggest coming a little later. We ended up waiting about 20 minutes, not too bad. We were seated a large booth that could easily fit 5 (there were 2 of us) but was nice and roomy. Decor is modern and some of the design aspects were interesting yet weird (ie: only seeing part of the kitchen, large communal table). We started off with drinks- the honey bee was nice with honey vodka, cranberry juice and ginger ale. Beer selections range from local breweries (San Tan and 4 Peaks) to domestics. \n","\n","Our waitress was very attentive and service was very good here. I ordered the Cali Benedict, which came with 2 poached eggs, bacon, avocado, tomato and hollandaise. My fiancé ordered the BLD burger with sweet potato fries. The BLD burger was GIANT and came with 2 beef patties, green chile pork, onion straws and a poached egg. The Benedict was good, eggs poached perfectly, the homemade potatoes were OK. The best part of the burger was the green chile pork...mmm!! Onion straws and beef patties were over cooked. One thing I did notice is some tables seated after us did get their food before us- which is something mentioned in other reviews. It wasn't a big deal for us as we were enjoying our Sunday brunch meal.\n","\n","All in all, we liked this place and would return.\n","before Great brewery with great food! The handlebar hefe is delicious! I also like that you can bring your dog and play board games here- very fun and casual place to hang out with friends while drinking good beer and eating delicious food. What's better than that?!\n","before I don't crave cupcakes often but when I do, I go to Sprinkles. Location is great, right off Scottsdale Road and Camelback. Lines can get long though (just means it's THAT good) so I wouldn't suggest coming if you're in a huge hurry. The staff there is really what makes my review 5 stars! Every single person I have ever encountered at Sprinkles is none other than friendly, sweet, accommodating and truly customer service orientated. I've seen some extremely rude, disrespectful people in there and am truly appalled at how they treat these amazing staff members! They will truly go out of their way to make sure you have a good experience so don't treat them like dirt! End rant.\n","\n","So, about the cupcakes. I am pretty sure I have tried most of the flavors (even the seasonal) and would recommend the following: black and white, cinnamon sugar, chai latte, chocolate peppermint (seasonal), vanilla milk chocolate and the bailey's one around St. Patty's day. As you can tell, I like my chocolate! I really haven't had a bad cupcake to be honest. I mean at $3.50 a pop, it better be good! They also sell some of the flavors for cake mixtures in store...mhm!! I also love how they will create a dozen box for you on most special occasions (birthdays, anniversary's, thank you, congratulations, etc.) They also do wedding cupcakes!! \n","\n","For every Sprinkles location I have been to, I have received top notch service and product. The cupcake ATM is also a unique touch too and hope Scottsdale gets one soon! Sprinkles is amazing and you should at least stop once if you haven't already!\n","before I have mixed feelings about this place. I have eaten inside and have done delivery. My experience with delivery was great! My Philly roll was even served on ice to stay cold! I also ordered the honey chicken, which was recommended from many Yelp reviewers and for me it was too sweet and soggy;  I would not order again. I came back a few weeks later with a friend and ate inside. The place was not busy yet we had to wait for a table, then were seated at a small table that had rips along the seats. This isn't a deal breaker but certainly didn't leave a good first impression. Service was slow, our waiter was very quiet and hard to understand. We ordered 3 rolls (the Gilbert roll, the Vegas Roll and the Philly Roll). The Gilbert roll was outstanding!! I have never had sweet potato inside a roll but it was sooo yummy!! The rest were so-so, nothing great. I did like the fact it's always happy hour so prices were very reasonable! They also do an all you can eat, which I found out after I had already ordered, darn it! I will come back because of the prices and the fact it is so close to my house. Is it the best sushi, no. But it's A-OK!\n","before I have given this place 3 chances to get it right for me and unfortunately, they struck out! I think the service is attentive yet their employees are annoying and try too hard to keep a conversation. I appreciate the \"Hi, how's your day going?\" but these guys just take it to another level...and not one I'm comfortable with I guess. I do not like the fact it is drive thru only and that you can't go in and sit down. Isn't that what a coffee shop is supposed to be? Most importantly, I just do not like their product.\n","\n","I have tried 2 of their infusion teas and their chai tea latte. The first tea I tried was a green tea mixed with blackberry and pomegranate syrups. I thought it was very watered down and didn't taste sweet enough. The second tea was also a green tea but had raspberry and pomegranate syrups. This tea was too sweet and just not good. I went again and decided to get their chai tea, which is my favorite tea, and was extremely underwhelemed. It tasted like their was NO chai tea at all, absolutely no spice whatsoever...all I could taste was the milk and maybe a little honey. Honestly, it was the worst chai tea latte I've ever had! \n","\n","Maybe if I only wanted a cup of coffee, this place would do it for me. But, I don't like coffee and like trying coffee shops for their teas and lemonades. Overall, this place just doesn't impress me at all and I would much rather spend my money at Starbucks or a local coffee shop.\n","before I had the most beautiful bridal shower at Arcadia Farms in their Hacienda room! The ONLY somewhat negatives are that the room is across from the actual restaurant and parking can be a bit of a challenge. The room, service and food were absolutely amazing for my tea party themed shower. Service was attentive, food was delicious (especially the desserts) and the space was nice and cool on a warm day. I would totally recommend having a private party here and going across the street and eating at the actual restaurant. Perfect!\n","before My parents introduced my husband and I to this restaurant, which is really a fast casual concept. I ordered the salmon and chicken, which came with 2 sides. I got the zucchini and brown rice for the sides. Everything I ate was very good and it comes on a good size plate. I was hungry again a few hours later though. It's very healthy here so definitely check this place out if you're searching for a healthy and tasty spot!\n","before I've come here twice and have enjoyed my experiences. I was able to score some adorable lanterns for home décor, bought my sister a vintage chalkboard for her upcoming wedding and some coasters for my dining table. I did have to return a wall plate I bought for a light switch, just because it didn't fit, but other than that, very much enjoy my purchases!\n","\n","The store is filled now with Christmas decorations! There's tons of stuff everywhere and have items to fill pretty much any room in the house. It's easy to get carried away here but totally worth a look! Check it out, I'm sure you will either get some great craft ideas or end up buying something!\n","before Hubby and I came here tonight but did the drive thru. This was my first time eating Popeye's. I ordered the chicken po boy combo and my husband got the 4 piece chicken combo. When we got home to eat, I noticed that my chicken was really dry and not very fresh. The coleslaw was OK and my husbands meal was fresher than mine but 2 of his pieces of chicken were tiny!! \n","\n","If the chicken was fresh, I think this would taste a lot better.\n","before We tried this place out on a Friday night for a friend's birthday. While we waited for our table, we sat outside on the patio with our drinks. The patio space was nice and had additional tables for people to sit and eat. Since it was a warm night, we decided to eat inside. We were seated right in front of the stage at a long table. As the night worn on and got more packed, sitting at this table wasn't exactly ideal because so many people were standing behind us from the bar and bumping into our chairs. It was also pretty dark inside so I did have trouble reading the menu (that's what the flashlight app on your smart phone is for I guess). The ambience of the restaurant was very impressive with the purple tile walls and huge chandeliers. It reminded me of Vegas?\n","\n","Our waitress was very friendly and helpful on drink and food choices. Our table started with the kettle chips and pretzels with provolone fondue. Ummm just have to say, the pretzels and fondue were fantastic!!! Huge hit at our table and we are still raving about them days after we ate them! The chips were also good.\n","\n","I decided to split the chopped vegetable salad and sweet corn canelloni with my boyfriend. The chopped vegetable salad was a nice light note with a ton of vegetables and worked well with our entree, the sweet corn canelloni. The canelloni was really good but if you're hungry, I wouldn't recommend splitting it. For us, we knew it was going to be a night of drinking so we didn't want to over-do it. Perfect amount for the occasion. I stuck with my usual white wine for the night but many of my friends ordered speciality cocktails. I was able to try a couple and thought they were strong but good. \n","\n","As we were leaving, the band came in and started playing. We could hear them through the loud speakers on the patio and they sounded pretty good, playing a few cover songs from popular pop\\/rock singers. It was definitely a fun place to go for a friday night and would return.\n","before I've been in a few times to get gift certificates but had not received services. I decided as a treat for my upcoming birthday, I would make an appointment for a pedicure. I arrived and was taken to a waiting area, with dimmed lighting, water and soft music playing in the background-very relaxing.  Shay came over and explained the pedicure process with me, as this was my first time. The 1 hr and 15 min pedicure started with a foot soak then was led to a private room. As I reclined in the zero gravity chair, Shay did an excellent job relaxing me and giving an unbelievable pedicure experience. If you're looking for the best pedicure, go here. It's pricey at $70 but I enjoyed every minute of it! Next time, I hope to book a massage!\n","before I will start my review by saying these shows aren't going to be for everyone. I took my sister here for her birthday and were seated at one of the tables in front of the stage. I felt like we were at a bingo hall, as the average age of the audience had to be at least 65+. We saw \"Murder at Greystone Manor\", which was very cheesy, the costumes and makeup are horrendous, the food was really mediocre but it was pretty entertaining! My sister was asked at one point to go up and dance!!! Great pictures! If you're not someone who's open to being \"picked\" on or being exposed to some mildly inappropriate comments\\/suggestions, I would not recommend this show. The murder part of this show was also lacking- the other parts of the storyline were focused on more than the actual murder. It was fun to receive an \"identity\" and get to solve the mystery.\n","\n","For $45\\/person, I think my sister and I had a great time and got to cross something off our bucket list. However, I highly doubt we will be back.\n","before I really hate going from a 5 star to a poor review but feel like management needs to be informed of their business so they can provide the best services possible to their customers. I no longer live in the area but decided to get an eyebrow wax, as I was in the area. My technician was Blake, who was very informative about the waxing process, but she honestly offended me. In my consultation before the eyebrow wax, she asked if I wanted to get my lip waxed. I said \"no\" and she asked if I've ever had it waxed before. I said yes, once, and the hair grew back darker. She explained how if it's not done right that can happen and advised me not to wax myself. I received the lip wax service at a professional salon and never told her I did it myself at home. She just replied \"oh, well if you want to get your lip waxed, you definitely have plenty of hair for it so just let me know.\" I was so appalled she said that I couldn't comment other than to repeat my previous \"no\" response. The eyebrow wax hurt really badly too, which is pretty unusual as I get regular eyebrow waxes. \n","\n","And, when I went to pay for the service, I noticed their prices increased from $16 to $18 for the eyebrow wax. That definitely didn't sit well either.\n","\n","I really don't think I will be back. I know technicians have different styles and personalities but even as a salesperson and a technician, I think it's crossing a line to tell someone they have \"plenty of hair\" to get that area waxed. If it's offered and they say NO, move on!!!\n","before Kabuki is my favorite sushi restaurant. The restaurant is nice, clean and lively. Happy hour is very reasonable to go for the rolls and drink specials, although regular menu prices aren't overpriced. I love getting their Dynamite roll and their Philly roll. I've even taken friends here that don't like sushi and they are able to find something to eat here. The chicken teriyaki is also delicious for those who don't enjoy sushi.\n","\n","I would definitely recommend for sushi and an overall nice meal. I live very close to this place and love their sushi so I will keep coming back!!\n","before I've been to Hooters a few times but never to this location. My friend and I went here for simple food on a late Friday night. The service was pretty slow but our waitress was friendly. I tried crab legs for the first time and was satisfied. They didn't have crackers for the shells so it was pretty difficult eating crab without crackers. I particularly enjoyed the teriyaki wings, bone in. Never had a problem with the food but just nothing great.\n","\n","The one thing I felt weird about was homeless people staring at customers while they ate their food. Our waitress even approached our table after our meal and asked us if we saw anyone take her tip off a table she has just served. She accused the homeless man we saw watching everyone eating of stealing the money. I thought that was low-class and not something that should be mentioed in front of other customers. I also thought management should have asked the homeless people to leave prior to the money being \"stolen\".\n","\n","Overall, it was so-so.\n","before I was having a bad hair day and wanted to get a blow out. Even though Drybar was a miss for me the first time, I decided to give it another chance (well after their grand opening). I was immediately greeted and asked if I wanted a beverage. My appointment began right on time. Brittany was my stylist and she was EXCELLENT! She clearly knew what she was doing- I appreciated that she told me every product that was going in my hair (permission granted first) and what the product would do. I also got the floater, which was a divine 10 minute scalp massage during my wash. It's $10 extra but so worth it! My appointment lasted an hour as I got my hair curled with a curling iron after it was blown out. She was a good salesperson because I also purchased the gold mine product, which helps with fly away's and serves as a leave in conditioner. She even showed me how the product works in her own hair...pretty cool! I connected well with Brittany and will ask for her again when I come back! Thanks Ali for reaching out to me after my first experience, customer service here is superb! I would recommend for a great experience and great hair!\n","before After signing up for their e-mail list, I was pleasantly surprised to find a $25 coupon sitting in my e-mail for my birthday. I had only been to the Keg once before (a very long time ago) so I was very excited to try again and take my boyfriend, who had never been. We did go on a weeknight (coupon stipulation for weekends) but liked the fact that it wasn't as hectic and busy as on a weekend night. Since it was my birthday dinner, my boyfriend I got all dressed up and went out for a nice dinner.\n","\n","We were seated immediately at a spacious booth next to a large fireplace. The ambience reminded me of an upscale lodge. Our server was very attentive and charismatic. He made our experience fun but not overwhelming us with unnecessary visits to our table. We were given a loaf of wonderful bread to start. Our server made awesome dinner selections, including my boyfriend's filet oscar entree. I went with the 10 oz filet mignon and a side of steamed veggies. We ordered our steaks cooked medium and medium rare. Both were cooked very well. Everything we ate was top notch!\n","\n","The best part comes with dessert! The GM came over to our table and not only wished me a Happy Birthday with his adorable baby boy in his arms but gave us a free Miner Pie. OMG it was incredible!! I think the idea of giving us that kind of service was better than the actual pie for dessert.\n","\n","For the food and service we received, the prices were on point. The Keg is not a cheap place but is very delicious and service was great. I will definitely return and my boyfriend even said he would return for his birthday dinner in the summertime :)\n","before I went to Crust with a group of friends on a weeknight. The ambience of the restaurant is fun but pretty tightly packed. I saw a gentleman with a walker literally not able to get around the tables to use the restroom. Our waiter was nice- other servers filled drinks and brought out our order. We were never told about any drink specials or what type of beer they have on tap until my fiancé asked, which was after we got our salads. One of my friends did not like the anti-pasta salad (I didn't try it) and they did take it off the bill. I was able to try Caesar salad with garlic bread, individual rustica pizza and a bite of the chicken parmigana meal. I liked everything I had- the shape of the pizza was the one thing that threw me off. If you haven't been, go check out this place just to see what I'm talking about. I took a picture and so did every table around us who ordered individual pizzas. I honestly wasn't blown away by the flavor of the food- it was good but not that good. I would probably come back but it's nowhere close to me so it would be for a special occasion.\n","before I've been hearing a lot of hype about Potbelly's lately so I decided since it's somewhat close to work, I'd try it out for a late lunch. I walked in thinking it looked pretty nice inside and thought it was helpful they had directions up above for how to order. I decided to order the turkey sandwich but substituted the swiss for provolone. The style of it reminded me a lot of Quiznos, especially with the sandwich going through the oven. I didn't like the fact that I couldn't see what was going in my sandwich (the glass was too high for me to see) but maybe it's because I'm short? Both girls who made my sandwich were really friendly and helpful to the \"newbie\". I decided to get my usual lettuce, tomato, mayo but also to add italian seasonings (salt, pepper, oregano). When I went to pay, the cashier was pretty distracted with another customer so I had a couple minutes to look at the desserts. I decide to get the oatmeal chocolate chip cookie, just for good measure. For a combo and the cookie, it was just under $10. Not bad but not great either on price.\n","\n","I go to sit down and literally every table is taken (and this was around 2:30PM). I didn't realize how few tables they have until I walked to the back of the restaurant. I settled for sitting at the bar against the window in between two strangers (nothing horrible just not preferred). I open my sandwich and was reminded of Quizno's yet again, minus the multi grain bread option I chose with my sandwich. It didn't taste bad by any means just nothing special or unique. The best thing I ate was the cookie, would TOTALLY recommend!! They also had a brownie\\/cookie looking thing that looked pretty amazing too!\n","\n","Overall, I liked the way it looked inside, especially with the older pictures of the Phoenix area displayed on the walls. I wish I would have had my own table but it wasn't that big of a deal. I guess I was expecting more but didn't exactly get it. I would honestly eat here again just not making my top list for favorite sandwich places. I'd personally recommend Togo's in Chandler and Casella's in Scottsdale for a unique and delicious sandwich experience.\n","before This was my first time into MOD- went in at the lunch rush. There were about 10 people in front of me in line but the line moved quickly. I really liked how friendly the employees were and how they explained everything. It's awesome you can add whatever toppings you want for the same price. I went with the Dillion James pizza but added chicken, mushrooms and green peppers. The menu is really inclusive with lots of options, even gluten free crust and dairy free cheese. For the pizza and drink, I paid a little over $10. I tried a sample of the blackberry lemonade and it was a little too sweet for me but I saw a lot of people drinking it. From waiting in line to ordering to receiving my pizza, I waited 15 min. Not bad at all! Pizza was a good size with 4 slices and tasted really good! I didn't finish everything but they conveniently have to go boxes by the drink station to take your leftovers home. Tables were being cleaned when I was there so it was very clean. \n","\n","I would definitely come back!\n","before I ordered the turkey sandwich and coleslaw on my stop for lunch. I liked everything I ordered but I felt it was a pricy. The sandwich was a good size though and took half of it home. The décor here is pretty dated but has ample seating. The options here were also plenty and had stuff I'd never heard of or seen before. It's definitely unique to the area so if you're in the mood for casual but good food, stop here.\n","before After seeing all the 2nd pasta helping commercials on TV, my boyfriend and I decided to have Italian for date night. We were seated promptly upon arrival but noticed an odd smell coming from the dining room. The wood burning grill was close to where we were seated but it smelled off. Our server was slow to arrive for drink orders and my boyfriend kept having to drink my water because our server neglected to fill water. I ordered a glass a wine, which of course was delicious. Bread came and was honestly the best thing we ate all night. I loved the olive oil and spice mixture! I ordered the pasta Carraba and a Caesar salad. The salad was really over-dressed and the dressing had quite a peppery kick. I like pepper but not overpowering. For the 2nd pasta helping, there were only 3 options and none of them resembled the pasta on the commercial. The pasta I ordered was very disappointing, very mushy. The chicken was grilled nicely but for $15.50, the pasta wasn't prepared better than what I could have made at home for a lot cheaper. We skipped dessert and took my leftover pasta home. I did like that we were given bread, olive oil and spice mixture (since that was delicious). It has been a while since I had visited Carraba's and now I know why. Everything was mediocre and for me, I don't like visiting places that are just OK.\n","before I came here after seeing some Craigslist furniture ads with an adorable ottoman posted for sale here. First of all, I almost couldn't park because the parking lot is tiny and literally right off the street. I think I almost caused an accident by braking so fast just so I wouldn't pass it. I walked past another antique like store (Charlie's House) and then walked into Qcumberz. Holy blazes was it hot in there!!! I don't know if the AC wasn't working or if they enjoy it being 95 degrees with hot air blowing around by fans but I was NOT impressed with that! Not once was I greeted by anyone either...bah. The store itself is a good size but there's just so much \"crap\" everywhere! I think I've learned that this kind of vintage just isn't my cup of tea. Nothing struck a cord with me, just a bunch of stuff I could see at my grandma's garage sale. I did find the ottoman I was looking for and it was so tiny...and for $69! I was shocked how small it was...the close up pictures really make it appear larger. And, the color on the ottoman picture was also different in person (in pictures it was green, in store it was light blue). Major disappointment! Overall, I did not like this store and would not return.\n","before I live in the area and shop in the Mekong plaza from time to time so I decided to check this place out for Pho. It's very casual, you can sit anywhere you like. It's a smaller restaurant with TV's around and tables for big groups and couples. I ordered my chicken pho to go and waited only 5 minutes (I didn't call ahead to order just walked in). Staff was very friendly and even offered me a glass of water while I waited. The pho itself is a very generous portion and for those that have never had it, it's like a soup on steroids! The broth is so fragrant and tasty...you add in the rice noodles, meat and veggies yourself. \n","\n","I really liked this place and would recommend!\n","before I love Costco! I'm not even a member here and I love coming (don't worry, I always come with members). It's busy on weekends (as expected) but slower on weeknights. Staff are friendly, food\\/drinks are cheap and I always spend way too much money here! On a side note, my boyfriend and I just bought our bedroom furniture set here and we are super impressed with the quality and price. Furniture stores are charging double or even triple what we paid for and we are completely happy with our purchase! I also like to browse Costco online to see what's not in store. So, I will happily keep returning, even if it's not this exact location!\n","before I went to the location on Southern and 16th street but didn't see that one listed so I decided to review this location, since it's the same food. I went in on my lunch break one day after a co-worker told me to check it out. I tried calling in advance, since on their flyer they advertise \"ready in 15 minutes\" if you call ahead and everytime I called, it was busy. I made sure to let them know that when I got there that had happened. They were checking into it before I left.\n","\n","Staff was friendly. I ordered a catfish sandwich, fried okra and a drink for $9. Food took about 10 minutes to make but it was nice and cool inside the restaurant so I didn't mind waiting. I asked for ranch and tartar sauce on the side. The tartar sauce for some reason is really good and I don't even like tartar sauce! I ate it with my sandwich and fried okra. The okra was pretty good and they give you a lot for $2.99. The catfish on the other hand wasn't my favorite. I keep reading that everyone loves their catfish but there were pieces of mine in my sandwich half cut and that made me feel weird to eat it. I also didn't think it had much flavor and felt the cornmeal breading was similar looking and eating to bird feed. \n","\n","They have a lot of choices; everything from fish to burgers so I think next time I will try something else. All in all, it was so-so. I would probably come back.\n","before I've been to Kona a few times but have learned the best time to go is happy hour. The place is lively and the drinks are awesome! I would definitely recommend the chambord margarita. It is one of the best margaritas I have ever had!! And, for $4, it's pretty inexpensive. I also enjoy their sushi and appetizers. \n","\n","Kona is a nice place to go for drinks and a meal. I would recommend it.\n","before We live just minutes from downtown Gilbert and were looking for a new place to check out. My fiancé and I came on a Thursday evening around 6PM and had to wait about 20 minutes for a table. A lot of large parties were there that night so the waiting area was really crowded and there was very limited seating to wait. We got our text saying a table was ready and were seated in a 4 top with a booth. \n","\n","Here are the things I really liked: The service was excellent- drinks were always refilled, we were asked several times how food was tasting and ended up staying a couple hours. Bartenders were great and the bar area is nice (and has all the TV's unless you sit outside on the patio). The food was really good- zucchini fries were hot and not overly battered. I got the breakfast burger and it was a party in my mouth! It came with a fried egg, cheese, bacon, lettuce and mayo- mmm good! The ice cream is also really good- we ended with a small vanilla shake. Oh and like other reviews have mentioned, the décor is modern and very nice! \n","\n","Things I wasn't too impressed with: The prices were steep- my burger was great but $12.50 is about $3 over priced in my opinion. The bathrooms are also outside- yes you have to walk outside just to use the restroom. And, they are tiny so if there's any kind of line, you're probably going to have to wait outside or just hold it. I also didn't like the limited beer menu- they do have some locals and domestics but not very many choices. Many of the beers are also served in cans- which is kind weird for this style of restaurant. \n","\n","At the end of the day, I will totally come back. But, only if I REALLY want a burger and fries (because that's really all they have other than some salads).\n","before I got a pedicure here on a weekday. From start to finish, it was 45 minutes. Salon is beautiful and the technician who gave me the pedicure was great. If you're in the area, check this place out for nails.\n","before If you are looking for a cool loft space with plenty of brick walls, this place definitely has all that! However, when I was told it was a wedding venue, I was surprised when they said 150 could fit. It's really small! You walk inside and the space where they hold cocktail hour is pretty tight...I would say no more than 50 could fit comfortably in the space. When you walk through the arches, the venue space was nice but small.The loft space for the bridal suite was really spectacular though! Granite countertops, shower area, couches, TV, extra \"room\" for more privacy...I thought it was the best part of this venue for a wedding! The groom's suite failed in comparison. It's located down a steep flight of stairs in a smelly basement with a measly foosball table, couch and TV. The ceremony space is also located next to the groom's suite...really dark and had a strange, unpleasant odor. I definitely wouldn't want to get married down there! They also don't have an elevator so guests who can't walk up and down a flight of steep stairs couldn't even see your wedding if they wanted to....a HUGE no-go for me! Overall, definitely not impressed for a wedding venue but did like the space for something more casual.\n","before I've been here several times and only eaten at the bar but this weekend, I sat in the dining room for a nice meal with my boyfriend. We walked in around 8:30PM on a Saturday night and didn't wait, although the dining room was pretty full. The booth was very spacious, could have easily fit 4-6 people. Chips and salsa were quick to arrive and the salsa is really amazing! Our waitress took our drink orders and was surprised when she said I couldn't have sugar around the rim of my margarita glass. Hmm...never encountered that one before. Margaritas were delicious though and only $4! We each had 2, they were kinda small. For dinner, I ordered chicken fajitas and my boyfriend ordered a burro with rice and beans. Our food came pretty quick and was really delicious! The fajitas came with different types of bell peppers, onions and tomatoes. Really good! The sour cream is also a little different, but good! Service was prompt, nothing over the top though. I would definitely recommend Matta's for good Mexican food!\n","before I'm sorry but this place is just not good. I've visited twice, as I wanted to give Sacks one more chance, and was more disappointed the second visit than with the first! \n","\n","First visit- my turkey sandwich ended up being almost $10! Super expensive! And, I ordered it on a baguette, thinking it would be a firm bread but instead, it was served on a super soft sub roll that became extremely soggy. I almost had to eat my turkey sandwich with a fork! \n","\n","Second visit- the place smelled awful, very musty and just not appealing at all. I decided to order a different sandwich on sourdough, for a sturdier bread. The ingredients are just sub-par for the price they charge, in my opinion! AND, I went up to the counter after waiting for 20 minutes to ask how much longer and the guy just handed me the bag, that was sitting in the to-go section, and didn't apologize, even after I said I had ordered 20 min prior. I also interrupted him texting on his cell phone. My bad...\n","\n","All in all, the small chocolate chip cookie is the most delicious item I was served here. I really want to like Sacks, as it's very close to work and I really love sandwiches but this is unfortunately not a place I will be returning to.\n","before I was in the area and decided I would check this place out. Let me just say this, the time to go to this place is around 3PM because you will get treated like a king (or in my case, a queen! :)\n","\n","I didn't really know what to order, so many choices, and Billie working behind the counter gave me several suggestions. I  go with the smoked turkey sandwich and red beans \u0026 rice for my side. She let me sample the beans before I got them (just to make sure they weren't too spicy). When I sat down, she asked if I would like a sample of the pork. Of course I do!! And damn I should have ordered the pork because it was delicious! The smoked turkey was good too just not like the pork. The BBQ sauce they put on too is sweet and yummy!! \n","\n","As I'm eating, Billie and another staff member come out and talk to me for about 20 minutes. Both are really cool, laid back people and enjoyed having some company (as I went in alone). The entire time I was there, nobody else came in so it was fun talking to the staff. Just want to point out they do get slammed for lunch and dinner but since 3PM on a Thursday is an odd time to eat, they weren't busy. \n","\n","Definitely loved this place and will be returning!!\n","before I would really give 3.5 stars but decided to be generous with 4. We went on a weeknight and were seated right away. Place has trivia to play on your phone so my boyfriend loved that and it was fun to play a game while eating\\/drinking. Our servers were pleasant and nice, chips and salsas came out right away. Love the chips and salsa, as well as the homemade bean dip! I could eat an insane amount of these! \n","\n","The menu has a lot of options to choose and I went with the chicken fajitas. Food came out quick and was hot! I wasn't a huge fan of the seasoning that was cooked with the fajitas, a little spicy for my taste. Rice and beans were delicious, too bad they charge an extra $1.25 for sour cream and guacamole. The margarita was also really good but $10. \n","\n","I haven't been on taco Tuesday but am interested in checking it out!\n","before I do like Chick-Fil-A but noticed some quality differences with this location from the other locations I have visited. The drive thru line at lunch is ridiculous (prepare to wait at least 15 minutes) but decided to wait anyways just for pure convenience and part laziness. Service was pleasant as always, I do like when they address you as \"Sir\" or \"Ma'm\" and say \"My Pleasure\". Staff is very accommodating and helpful. However, when I got back to eat my lunch, I noticed the chicken sandwich I ordered was very overcooked and the lettuce was soggy and almost brown in color. The usual large piece of tomato was just two measly tomato slices plopped down. Honestly, I did eat it but was very surprised at what the quality was here...I've never had this issue before. I hope management reads this and can improve their product.\n","before I decided to take my boyfriend out for a nice Sunday breakfast at a nice little cafe around the corner from his house. We arrived a little after 11AM and had to wait about 15 minutes. Once we were seated, we noticed how cute the decor inside was and how many great choices the menu offers. I decided to get an omellete, red potatoes and biscuits and gravy. We waited about 15 minutes for food but everything that came out was good. Service was spotty but not complaining. I would come back to try some of the other menu items.\n","before I am a regular customer of Einstein Bagels and this was my first visit to the Val Vista location. The place was absolutely filthy- there were bagels on the floor behind the counter, crumbs everywhere, the ceiling was yellow and had huge water spots, the utensils they were using to make the drinks were just lying on dirty countertops, the food line looked like it needed to be scrubbed...\n","\n","Anyways, I order my usual Nova Lox (no red onion and capers). They were very understaffed so the line moved really slow and the lady at the cash register to pay was also swamped with all the drink orders. After 10 minutes or so, I hear my name called for my food and they made it with red onion and capers. I told them I ordered it without that and the guy re-made it. No apology, just grabbed the bag and re-made it. \n","\n","I honestly would never come back to this location- it was the worst I've ever seen\n","before I came here without an appointment and was immediately greeted then taken over to the bar for my manicure. Salon was clean and lots of people were working that day! My nail stylist was friendly and spent quality time making sure my nails looked great. For $35, I got a great gel manicure with glitter detail, which is a much better price from what I have paid in other salons for gel and glitter. As a tip, they do not accept credit card gratuitity so make sure you have cash on hand. In case you are unaware or forget, there is an ATM located inside and doesn't charge an extra fee! If I'm in the area again and need\\/want my nails done, I will be sure to visit again!\n","before I was in the market for a new 2017 Nissan Sentra SV and decided to go to ABC Nissan again, as I had purchased a 2009 Nissan Altima from them back in 2010. After being there for 2 hours, we were told the sale price they advertised online was not the price they could do for us. They wanted to charge us $2,000 in EXTRA ADD ONS and when we told them we weren't paying for that, they told us \"every Nissan dealership adds these add-ons and couldn't be negotiated.\" What bullcrap! We also had a trade in and they weren't willing to give us anywhere close to what the car could get. The manager came out at that point and insulted us about how my car wasn't \"worth\" what we knew we could sell it for private party and how they weren't going to budge on monthly payment terms and price. Mind you I have an amazing credit score, we were putting money down and genuinely wanted to do a deal with them. They basically told us to go somewhere else. Wow.\n","\n","I am happy to report that I have since purchased a 2017 Nissan Sentra SV from AutoNation Chandler and had an outstanding experience! Great staff (not pushy), great interest rate, monthly payments and terms are exactly what I wanted AND I got what my car deserved for trade in! I highly recommend going there and not wasting your time with ABC Nissan!!\n","before Chris was great about getting back to me quickly with answers to all my questions.  The driver  Tom was so nicecto my son and his prom date. Would definitely  recommend  and use again.\n","before I've been coming to Toby's for years and yeah the establishment isn't the nicest, especially the back area but I still love it.  The wings are in my top 5 of Toronto and an added bonus is that they come with fries.  People rant and rave about Duff's, St Louis but the wings at Toby's are better in my opinion.  They're a good size (not super steriod looking) and they're nice and saucy.  The servers are nice and they can take a joke.  \n","On cheap pitcher night there is nothing to complain about except for the occasional loud and obnoxious group which happens in most bars\\/restaurants.  \n","The other food on the menu is pretty average.  I've had the nachos and a burger but the jewel of this place is the cheap wings and cheap booze.  If you're looking for a low key fun night then I'd highly recommend Toby's.\n","before I'd eat here everyday for every meal if I could. The food here is absolutely delicious! This is probably my favourite restaurant in Toronto. It's nice and cozy and the prices are a little higher than other restaurants but the food is worth it. Depending on what you order portions maybe medium to small.\n","They have a nice alcohol selection that isn't to overwhelming. Their winter luscious menu is good but their regular menu has all the great stuff. \n","My only complaint is that it can get a little tight when it's really busy.\n","If you haven't tried it then make your way there tonight... With a date or a loved one.\n","before Ok before I start it's not that this place is bad but I've had a lot of Chinese food in my life time and it just didn't meet those standards of Chinese food I expect. When I order Chinese food I like big portions so the next day I can enjoy the leftovers. My brother and I ordered 4 dishes and the portions weren't the greatest for the price we paid. Food wasn't bad but wasn't great either. It's questionable whether or not we'll order from here again.\n","So far there's only one Chinese food place in the area I've found has reasonable prices and good portions. I'm not going to name it here because that would be pretty bad. It's an ongoing process trying to find the best food for a good price.  I haven't tried their combination plates which I'm willing to try and see if I like those better.  \n","To be fair it was our first time ordering takeout from here and maybe it's better than what we experienced.\n","If we try it again and it's better I will edit this review.\n","Thank you!\n","before I've been debating wether I should give this place a 4* or 3*. I ended up going with a 3 but don't get me wrong I really like this place. This is a great place for comfort food and big portions. \n","If you're in the east end and can't decide on a breakfast place I'd say Tulip is one of your best options. The interior of the restaurant is like a diner and yeah might be old but like I said you're going for big portions and good food. \n","I do recommend this place to my friends and family and am not reluctant to bring anyone here. It's pretty quiet too which is nice while enjoying your meal.\n","before Went here to eat today with some family members and when we first entered we were pretty excited. It's had some renovations and the dishes popping out we're looking good. I left most of the ordering to my brother and sister in-law while I watched my niece.\n","A salad came out first that wasn't really touched but next came the butter chicken. If an Indian restaurant can't make butter chicken right then we have a problem. It was good but been there done that. Next came out a vegetarian dish with lentils. Wasn't bad and out came our plain rice. Oh and plain naan and garlic naan. \n","The food was ok and overall everyone seemed content with the portion. Just shy of being comfortably full. The wait staff is very nice and water is going around regularly. They did forget to bring out one dish that we were anticipating the most. A sizzling beef dish but it never came out.\n","Not a great meal and I probably won't return. The food is the same as almost any other Indian restaurant I've been to. This wasn't my brothers choice either. It was my sister in-laws and she was quite disappointed as well.\n","before I've been here about 4 times now and each time I see an improvement on their service and speeds. I really enjoy the quality of the food here. The sushi tastes fresh and the other foods are quite tasty as well. Their rolls are well made but the last time I went they didn't have spider rolls which are my favourite so I was a little disappointed with that.  Minus that one set back ordered lots of sashimi, a variety of rolls, and the kids that were with us (under 3) went to town on the avocado and shrimp tempura.\n","There are some other things to be aware of like they have the leaf which is supposed to represent a vegetarian option beside some obvious meat items... Small things like that I find amusing though.\n","This is now probably my favourite sushi place in town and even though it's out of the way for me, about 12km one way, I'll continue to make that trip to eat here. There are other sushi places closer to me but I still prefer California Roll.\n","Hope you guys enjoy it as much as I do.\n","before I've had many burgers. I've tried those crazy burgers like Dangerous Dan's Quadruple C, the Burger Priests.. Don't remember what it was called and this place is hands down the best burger place I've had. The burger is tasty and fresh. Their poutine is flavourful and not overly cheesy. They put the right amount of gravy to make one of the best poutines in town. \n","Their prices are very reasonable. I can never get it when I pay close to $20 for a burger, fries and drink. It's a burger combo for petes sake.\n","I will be dropping by quite often. My brother first recommended this place and now we both love it.\n","before I had a craving for fish and chips because my brother had brought some home the night before. He opened up the box and we're pretty big eaters so any place that only gives one piece of fish we complain. So the next day I thought I'd give it a try. \n","I ride my bicycle over and ordered the Ackroyd. The order took a little while to prepare so if it's really busy be prepared to wait a bit. I felt bad I didn't leave a tip but it's my first time trying out the place and don't believe in tips until I've had it 2-3 times and they're consistent. I opened up the box by the beach and I already knew what to expect. I took my first bite of the fish and man was it tasty! The batter was delicious and the tartar sauce nice and light. The fish was tender, not too chewy and had a good taste.\n","The French fries. I usually prefer my fries cut as shoestring and seeing how big these were I was a little disappointed. I popped one in my mouth and these were some darn good fries. Crispy outside and nice on the inside. Lightly salted and then I proceeded to do something stupid. I put vinegar on them and it ruined the fries crispness. \n","Coleslaw. Not something I look forward to but even their coleslaw was good! Just the right amount of tanginess in the dressing and the green onion complimented it nicely.\n","I gave a 4 star because it was only my first time there. In the future given consistency in their food it could be 5.\n","If you're a fan of fish and chips it's definitely worth a try. Even if you're not, this place has lots of potential.\n","before One of my favourite places to eat for good sandwiches, soup and pastries.  The one by Sherway is my go to location.  The people working there are friendly and the service is good.  The locations have a nice warm feel to them as if you're at a cottage minus the urban jungle when you look out the window.  As soon as I walk in I get excited about the sandwiches and I'm not a big bread eater.  In the US I'd say their menu is a little different and a little better but it's still good here. \n","The ingredients in their sandwiches taste fresh and compliment each other well.  The soups taste homemade and not like they're out of a can.  The pastries are a little more of a hit and miss for me.  I enjoy their chocolate croissants but their cookies are average.  Whenever I'm on a road trip going through the states Panera Bread is my favourite place to stop off and grab some food.  The coffee is average as well but that's because I like Starbucks coffee. \n","If you're ever passing one and you're wondering about how it is, stop and give it a try because there are lots of options and it's delicious.\n","before I bought a groupon for Wabora a while ago and decided to use it with my friend.  \n","First I'd like to state the pros and why I gave it 3 out of 5 stars.  The food is good.  It's nothing special.  It's presented well and the taste of the food is good but again nothing special.  The establishment is nice and is in a posh trendy area.  After ordering the food took approximately 15-20 (about average time) minutes and looked quite good.  I ordered the Fire Chicken and my friend had ordered  the Spicy Pork Bulgogi.\n","Some cons, my dish was about $27 and my friends dish about the same at $30.  He's not Korean but I am.  To pay a whooping $30 each for our dishes was pretty outrageous.  To go out to an actual Korean restaurant and order $60 of food, you'd end up with a feast to feed 8-10 people.  The ambiance was nice though and the background sound was loud but not overly crazy.  \n","I probably won't return to Wabora only because I feel that it's overpriced for what you're getting.  I'm not discouraging others from going though.  The food was good and  the place is classy.\n","before Dr Lee was recommended to me by a friend after being bothered by some shoulder pain from weight lifting.  It's close to my work and from the reception to Dr Lee it's an overall pleasant experience.  The facility is nice and easy to access, especially if you're working in the financial district.  It was a painful first session but I really needed it after the pain I was experiencing the weeks before.  I went to Physiomed a couple times before and it was the most useless excuse for treatment I have ever received.  No working the shoulder and no relief.  They just kept going over the area with an ultrasound pulsing machine and I paid about $80 for each treament.  \n","Dr Lee really listened to what was bothering me and worked my shoulder in.  I was sweating bullets in my first session but the same day my shoulder felt good as new.  He also gave me some light exercises to do in my spare time to work my shoulder and even out the muscle.  \n","Overall a great experience and glad that my shoulder finally feels better.  I would highly recommend this clinic to my friends and family and will return for future treatments.\n","before I'm at a loss for words.  Ellington Funeral Service Is definitely the cream of the crop when it comes to Funerals and memorials.  My son, Tyler's service was in the care of Mr. Hunter.  He treated my son and all of us as if we were his own family.  This type of customer service in a time like this cant be taught, it has to be wholesome and come from the heart.  I cant say thank you enough Mr. Hunter.\n","before Great service each time I visit Nikki. Never disappointed with my hair. I'm glad I found her..\n","before I recently dined at Sazon Bachata.  Visiting from out of town and in search of places to dance Bachata, I Googled \"Bachata Phoenix AZ\". To my surprise, this restaurant was listed.  The name caught my attention.  I was thoroughly pleased!  The food was DELICIOUS! The family owned staff were extremely warm and pleasant.  I felt as though I were dining with family. I ordered Pollo Guisado, but it wasn't available. The young girl who took my order suggested I try the bistec instead. I ordered the bistec with arroz blanco, habichuelas and maduros.  Then, I topped it off with a morir sonando for the road.  I was also given information on Dominican places to dance Bachata.  Looks like I'll have a lot to do on my next visit.  Oh yes, there will definitely be a next time.  Much success to Sazon Bachata!\n","before Security was rude as hell, nothing was explained about the show, how it was going to function, if we should get there early, what the VIP tickets would get us, etc. the que system was laughable a 3rd grader could have organized these kids better. Security also grabbed and pushed me so that I couldn't high five the lead singer (WHICH HE ASKED THE CROWD TO DO). It just seemed way too strict and I won't be going to shows here or staying at hard rock i'll just see my artists in LA.\n","before I can't give a bad review about a doughnut place....Although I was disappointed that my treat here tasted the same as one from KK--not a bad thing though. \n","\n","Albeit it was $0.20 cheaper per fried goodness which is a pro. \n","\n","They had a very interesting Oreo encrusted cream filled doughnut which my BF particularly enjoyed. \n","\n","Not much to keep me coming back and choosing Greenbush's over another chain except that I try to avoid chains when I can.\n","before Not sure what was going on with the kitchen that night--i think the chef may have gone missing for an hour or the stoves weren't working?? It took over an hour for the food to come out after we had ordered-with no explanation- and the couple next to us had been waiting before we had even been seated. They got free wine refills because they had been waiting for so long!\n","\n","I'm not sure if it was the fact that we were starving by the time the food came out but it was DELISH and I loved everything about it!\n","before Cute cute place with good food! Surprising since it's on the first floor of an office building but I'm not judging by the cover;)\n","\n","We had the cheese fondue as an appetizer which was so so good!!! \n","The Mahi entree I had was a little more rare then I'd like but it was a good new experience. I loved the asian cabbage slaw and the sticky rice was divine. There was sauce on the mahi and on the plate but it was not overwhelming at all. They know what they are doing there! I would TOTALLY go back again!!!\n","before Didn't go into the bar area so this review is only for the dining room.\n","\n","Pretty small dining room area but they packed in as many chairs\\/tables as possible. You order and pick up at the same counter so customer service is really negligible. It seems like a larger scale chipotle.\n","Since you aren't reserving tables you can fit in a larger group (as long as you grab the seats as they become available). You can also stay as long as you want since you don't have to worry about a waiter rushing you to leave. Also each person can walk up to the counter and order their food so there is no mess with splitting the bill. \n","\n","Their turkey burger with the cilantro mess on top was awesome. BF had the steak sandwich and he loved it. Everyone else in the party seemed to be happy with their food as well. \n","\n","\n","Downside--wait was FOREVER!! And the chairs were just plain wood. Ouch. \n","\n","Although we had a pleasant experience...I'm not dying to go back again.\n","before WOW really......carbs on carbs on fat on carbs....\n","\n","if you want super junk pizza and a huge slice within 5 minutes of ordering than this is your place. They have tons of options for you like a pizza with avocados, beef, sour cream....a burrito pizza if you will.\n","\n","Their Mac \u0026 cheese pizza is supposed to be super popular but really Madison, really?\n","before Great location, very open\\/bright layout but prices on produce aren't competitive with Woodman's. They have a great selection and huge variety but I don't see myself coming back here unless I'm in that part of town and in dire need of something.\n","\n","They do stock some unique fruits that aren't available elsewhere (ie dragonfruit, persimmon, etc).\n","before Pizza Brutta had a \"Yelp Check-in Offer\" that we really couldn't refuse. \n","\n","The BF and I were sitting at a Starbucks deciding where to have dinner and of course using our favorite iPhone App--Yelp! And we noticed that PB was offering a free Margherita pizza with the purchase of another regular pizza. We jumped in the car and headed over! \n","\n","The crust was soft and melted in our mouths. The ingredients were so fresh the basil\\/spinach leaves looked as if it had just been plucked outside. The sauce was so flavorful and fresh. \n","\n","I really can't emphasize I how fresh the food was. I will be coming back even without being bribed with a Check In Offer.\n","before Had two different experiences, went once for a facial w\\/ acne add on and loved it so much that I went back to try out their hair stylist. \n","\n","Let's start off with the facial: It was fabulous. The room was all the way back away from the louder area of the salon\\/spa so it was really quiet. I was so happy about that because that is the worst thing-listening to other people in the hallway while you're trying to relax. The lady who performed the service was amazing and so skilled. I melted in her hands and it was the best facial i've ever had. \n","They had some offer as I was checking out that I would be entered into a raffle for prebooking appointments which I did- but left the ticket on the counter. Called back 10 minutes after I left and all I got was a sorry :\\/ \n","\n","For the haircut: This will break down into another two sections: the haircut and the style. For the cut itself I was not displeased, but I wasn't in love with the cut either. It doesn't seem like any weight was taken out of my hair and the layers weren't as distinct as I normally have them. If I had gone for a style alone I would have left one star. It was a blowdry that I would have expected from someone still in school. My hair was a big frizz ball and didn't look like I had just come from a salon and spent $55 for a level 4 stylist. (one of their mid-high stylist)\n","\n","As I left I asked the front desk what they thought, they thought I looked great, very unenthusiastically ;) I took a picture and sent it to their manager--she offered a free style. Great, but I wasn't too excited to back anytime soon. \n","\n","I'll be back for another facial--but still searching for a good stylist!\n","before Pizza didn't live up to the hype. Pretty standard fare. The restaurant itself is cozy though I'm not a fan of the low ceilings and feeling trapped underground. Oops.\n","before DJ booth, pool table, arcade games, mechanical bull, long bar with a ton of stools, and spacious middle ground with tables and room for dancing (if you care to-most people dont). \n","\n","Definitely a recipe for a good time!\n","before Had the sirloin steak and was not impressed. Wings for appetizers were nothing special--something I could've bought and made from a box. \n","\n","BFs steak was good but it was smothered in sauce...so not sure if it was the sauce or the actual meat. Mine was super dry and I didn't finish it :( \n","\n","I did get a 10% discount through my employer so that was nice!\n","before Short but helpful staff. And great new building in a great new shopping center. Lots of self-checkout and fabulous hours (until 9 on fridays!)\n","before HOLY SMOKES the burger was HUGE. I had to take a break in between bites to regain my composure before digging in again.\n","It was our first time in an Irish place but we weren't too adventurous. The Hail Mary although big, wasn't our fav Madison burger. \n","Spinach and artichoke dip (see my pic) was really generous and we were totally filled up on that before the burger even arrived! That is a \"must order\" if you go!\n","before Meat was completely rock solid frozen. I don't think that's normal compared to other mongolian grills (let's call it MG) I have been to but maybe its better sanitation wise? I thought my meat turned out good, my bf's meat was still cold in some parts and he complained the meat was tough.  (I will say that I was very hungry and inhaled the food in half the time that my bf did even though he's 3x's my size--which never happens) \n","\n","Meat selection wasn't that extensive compared to other MG's i've been to. \n","\n","We went on labor day and they were open (yay!) and there wasn't a line to get to the grill.\n","before CUTE boutique salon and spa...I got a hair cut with Lindsay who was nice, friendly, and pleasantly chatty. I was promptly taken back with her and offered tea (yum), we talked about my plan for my hair style, she did a lavender oil scalp massage (wow), we got to the shampoo room which is blocked off with a thick curtain to give you some privacy and combined with the lavishness with Aveda products it makes something mundane absolutely SERENE! \n","\n","The cut itself was great and she blowdried\\/flat ironed my hair. A COMPLIMENTARY hand massage was offered (didn't take it :(  ), a COMPLIMENTARY make up touch up was offered (powder, blush, lip gloss was applied), and a COMPLIMENTARY 5 minute photo shoot was offered (sorry no time today Studio 262). Very cool approach and it made a monthly experience SPECIAL!!! \n","\n","It was about $40 for the cut and i have LONG hair! \n","\n","They also have a fabulous monthly spa membership for just $59\\/month---I will be checking it  out soon!\n","before You have to be a certain type of special person to like this food and be in a certain special state of mind to want to come here....like you have to have a heart attack a few seconds after taking a bite. \n","\n","If that's you and that's what you want. Have a ball. I will be enjoying not having clogged arteries somewhere else....\n","before Not busy like the locations I'm used to on the east coast so I'm really happy that I can enjoy perusing the aisles in peace. \n","\n","For some reason the samples still always run out by the time I get to it though :(\n","before They ran out of buns the night that we were there. Boo. \n","The Ramen was ok. They charge you for the hot sauce (don't think it was even house made--maybe just Sriracha?). Really? I mean it should be standard for a bottle of it to be on the table. Their dumplings were SMOTHERED in oil and I am NOT a fan of that. \n","\n","If we have to be back fine, but trust me I won't be the one to suggest it.\n","before This bar is defintely for the college age crowd that likes to drink heavily and get really rowdy. It is a zoo after football games (when I went) and the crowd was way too obnoxious for me. I've heard that they infuse their own vodka which sounds pretty cool and I will definitely be back to try that....but probably earlier on in the evening...and probably not anytime near a football game!\n","before AMAZING service by the lady at the information desk....so sad that I wasn't able to catch her name :(\n","\n","She spent over 15 minutes looking up to make sure I got the right library card and explained the differences and benefits of the one that I got. I live in a new part of town and wasn't coming up on her system so she called two different places to get the info.\n","\n","Then she went over all of the locations, found the one closest to me, and gave me the lay out of the library. She also made sure that I knew what the fines were for overdue books\\/dvd's so I wouldn't have to pay anything ;) \n","\n","Now about this library, it is right off a busy street and I guess the shopping center that it's located in is pretty popular because parking was hard to find! The library is well maintained and seems fairly new! There is a pretty hardcore DVD selection and there are some actual movies that are fairly new (past 2 years)..... among all of the national geographic documentaries of course ;) \n","\n","I got some yoga DVD's and a great book on healing the body through food! Just goes to show you that they have a great variety of material in their system!\n","before GREAT place to work!!! Environment is SO welcoming and open...unlike any other place I've ever worked at!\n","before I loved their intricate coffee types and decor that looked very eco friendly. I wish I had known that this location was so close to the lake earlier on during the summer so I could have enjoyed it but nonetheless I will definitely be grabbing a cup of coffee to go, bundling up and walking along the lake!\n","before Good enough service and decent food for a sports bar. I enjoyed my fajitas and fried cheese curds. It seemed that everyone else in my party enjoyed their food as well. \n","\n","There was a huge projector set up to play the game against a wall and there was a table of people setting up their fantasy football draft. \n","\n","All of these really added to the \"neighborhood sports bar feel\".\n","before Came here for a birthday dinner and this place did NOT disappoint. They have such COOL food here that are not only delicious but also visually delicious!! \n","\n","I LOVED LOVED LOVED their chicken wings....I mean really!!! Gourmet wings!!!! They were asian-ish and soooooo goood!!! I almost ALMOST cancelled the rest of our order and just asked for more wings ;)\n","\n","From our friend who had been here in past months it seems like they have updated their style and menu....and for the better! It is a tapas style restaurant but the serving amounts were decent! I also had a citrus (adult) drink...can't remember the name now...but it was delicious :)\n","\n","I can't wait to go back!!\n","before I'm all for quaint family owned and operated places because there is a lot of potential and undiscovered delicious dishes. This is not one of those places. They need to apply to be on Restaurant Impossible because they need an overhaul. Their decor makes no sense whatsoever and the food was horrible. Their chips and salsa was great but it's pretty hard to mess that up. What's up La Mestiza?\n","before I hadn't logged in to my yelp account in quite awhile, and today I logged in to a few horrible messages regarding my review of TR Mckenzie...and now I see someone else had \"called me out\" in another post. I lived in the apartment complexes in Aspen Hill for two years, which I believe at the time was their newest location, so all of the amenities that I had were amazing and really well maintained. The staff threw fun parties and both me and my husband had a great time when we were living there. I WISH i had gotten some sort of benefit from writing that review but I received nothing for that review, not even a thank you post it. We never had to sublease or finish our lease early or dealt with any complaints so we had no problem with the staff. We did not get our deposit back even though we thought we left the place in great shape which was disappointing but we never followed up to see why either. \n","Anyways I guess my original review should've specified that I lived at Aspen hill, that may have cleared up some of the \"confusion\" as to why my review was so good!\n","before I believe people go here for the view, not the food. That should say enough about Fresco. \n","\n","If you must go here are some tips:\n","\n","1. Outdoor seating is a must and try to get a chair at the table that is facing the capitol. \n","2. Try to go before all the college kids are back on campus-otherwise friday\\/saturday night partying = lots of sirens. ;)\n","3. If you're hungry get the seafood pasta dish, the lamb chops that the fiance got were a small portion that he ended up eating off my plate too!\n","before Wow, wow, wow! You can tell that each and every dish is the result of a real chef that CARES about being creative, unique, and innovative with the food that his restaurant produces. \n","\n","It's restaurants like A Pig in a Fur Coat that have made me crave and love local businesses and shudder at chains. There is so much passion and thought oozing form every duck fat laden dish!\n","before This is the best sushi I have ever had.\n","Unfortunately, not the best customer service. It wasn't horrible, but after dinner my bf and I agreed that if the service had been a bit better we would have been over the moon happy with Takara. \n","\n","That being said....we will still go back time and time again because the sushi was seriously that amazing.\n","before I was walking on the treadmill, cooling down after my workout and I went to check in at the gym on Yelp....the first few reviews that came up were all negative and i was shocked that my gym had such a low star rating....So I am now compelled to write a review and really put things in perspective for you if you are thinking twice about joining after reading those bad reviews...\n","\n","#1. You are at a gym not the Rtiz Spa....So there isn't' someone waiting on your hand and foot every second. If you need something done there are always people at the front desk, trainers in their \"area\", and the manager's door is always open. All of the employees greet\\/acknowledge you verbally, with a smile, or a wave whether they are busy or not. That's pretty great customer service to me...\n","\n","#2. You are paying for a GYM membership...not a SPA membership...so yes they will charge for extra amenities like tanning, towels, smoothies, kids club, etc. There is no reason that I should pay a huge monthly fee for services that i don't plan on using...so splitting up the cost so that people like me that go to a gym to actually use the GYM aspect of it don't' have to pay for the \"extras\". That being said, if you want to use other stuff than the GYM then pay up! I have been a member of several gyms--mostly Gold's (going on 3 years now!) but also Sport and Health and Fitness First (those are two fairly large chain gyms but not sure if they are only on the East Coast) and they all have similar policies...you pay for the amenities that you want to use.\n","\n","#3. I have been a member for this gym specifically for 2 months and I go there 6 times a week. I have never EVER seen an \"out of order\" sign at any machine. \n","\n","#4. The gym is always kept in immaculate condition. I am always seeing one or two people cleaning something every time i go! \n","\n","#5. A gym is still a business...if you need to move or just want to stop going you need to give them notice....just like at your apartment or any other place that you pay a monthly subscription fee. That's just the way it is...\n","\n","#6. Yes the gym gets crowded at peak hours....that's why they are called peak hours...grocery stores also get crowded on the weekend...does that mean that they are horrible places and deserve a lower rating? Not in my opinion.\n","\n","Anyways....The trainers here are very knowledgeable as they have helped me out in the past with a few things--I've seen them work with a whole range of people from athletes to people who are trying to loose a lot of weight. I've only seen a few of them in action (Robert and Mike) but they are there all the time and so friendly :)\n","before Decor is cute but it doesn't go together at all and although i'm sure they are doing that on purpose and going for a charming\\/quaint look it really isn't working. \n","\n","I had a black coffee and plain waffle. Waffle was amazing (of course:)) and delivered very promptly. Coffee wasn't freshly brewed and the canister of the medium roast was out (and i didn't want to wait for them to fill it) so i just got the dark roast. It was decent but not great coffee.\n","\n","There was an assorted group of people at 10am on a weekday--moms with their kids, businessmen having a meeting, a guy meeting his contractor, and the hippy college kid. It was a fun crowd.\n","\n","If im in the area and really needing caffeine i might be back but no special trips out here.\n","before Huge location and great selection of goods. It's much larger than Dollar plus that's across from Woodman's off Watt's rd.\n","before Tons of flavors; free sampling before you load up; and lots of toppings. Two options for sizing and line moves pretty fast. They offer a rewards card--probably don't want to get that otherwise you will be here EVERY WEEK haha.\n","\n","I usually stick to 2 basic flavors--something chocolate-and throw in a \"seasonal\". For example over the holidays I loved their egg nog flavor!! The BF loves the red velvet and gets heaps of it when he goes!\n","before Tapas......oh tapas.....\n","\n","The good the bad and the ugly:\n","\n","Everything we ordered (minus the chicken satay) were all impeccable.....but the wait in between got my mouth watering so much for the next dish that it was hard to contain myself. \n","\n","it was also too bad that our dinner-mates that opted to go sans-tapas and more the traditional entree course were left waiting with empty plates while we were delivered several dishes. \n"," \n","The delicateness of the oxtail strudel, the delicious bruchetta, fried spicy calamari, were amazing. The tuna tartare was not impressive and the chocolate fondue was just plain chocolate syrup. $16 for lukewarm chocolate syrup was ridiculous. \n","\n","Although we extremely disliked a few things.....at least we know now what to avoid and we will definitely be back because the dishes we DID like......were AMAZING!  And well worth another trip!\n","before Hilldale houses some decent stores but the inside is like an airport and a lot of the retail spaces are empty. I was there on a Saturday but surprisingly \n","There is an attached gourmet supermarket and nearby Target. Sundance cinema is also a part of the shopping center which apparently features a few big name movies but mostly indie films. They have a neat bar offering coffee\\/sandwiches\\/wine\\/beer all to be enjoyed outside in the lounge area featuring really lovely leather couches and rustic wooden tables. If you are there to enjoy a movie you can take the food and drink inside the theater.\n","before Farm And Fleet literally has everything you could ever want...it's a home depot, wal mart, and specialty farmer's store all rolled into one. And triple the parking of all of those stores. The prices there rival all of the above listed stores so you know you can expect to get some good deals. One thing that makes it better than the above listed??? The quality of the clothes that they offer are much better (they sell brands like puma, addidas, etc) than what you would find at wal mart. Also they have a huge section where they sell a lot of \"working clothes\" reflective gear, overalls, work boots, etc. So if you need anything along those lines (even if you're not a farmer) you can come here and find what you need.\n","\n","They don't have a produce section but who needs fresh produce when you've got 3 aisles of candy!?!? \n","\n","It was also fun sifting through their halloween\\/thanksgiving items in August. It may be a bit early but being reminded of the fun holidays that are coming up made me feel better about summer being almost over :\\/\n","\n","Staff was helpful and super friendly as well.\n","before Awesome turtle cheesecake cupcake. It was delicious!!! Nothing else has to be said beyond that.\n","before I LOVED that they have more well maintained furniture unlike some other thrift stores. They actually have a pretty large housewares section as well! Lots of plates\\/cups\\/utensils, and quite a few bone china sets--if you're into that sort of thing! \n","\n","They also had fabulous FUR coats on display....of course at $1k they are still pretty pricey, but I'm sure WAY cheaper than what they would retail for. Pretty cool that they have these kinds of items here. \n","\n","If you're looking for odds\\/ends and some classy tea sets without the hefty pricetag--then you're bound to find something here!!\n","before The host was amazing--nick I believe.  If you're going for a cheap meal and good appetizers this is the place. Their 2 for $10 or 2 for $15 (appetizer and entree) is awesome. Their drinks are really weak though!\n","before Food was fine. The ringing of the \"Birthday bell\" was very obtrusive and I had to knock down a star.\n","before Super slow service....kinds of ridiculous really how long we waited to order and then to receive our food. \n","\n","It was definitely worth the wait but this would not be my first option when looking for a quick bite, or even a moderately quick bite! (expect to spend at least 2 hours here) \n","\n","We were here for brunch on Saturday and there was about a 15-20 minute wait which went by quick! I got the burger on a biscuit and the salad that came with it was great! I was NOT full after and was disappointed at how small the \"burger\" was. The BF got the loaded sandwich (i think that's the name) and that was WAY better--we went halfsies so we could try both ;) \n","\n","In the end, don't come starving because there it will be a bit of time before you get your food and order the loaded breakfast sandwich!!!! MMMm Ham ;)\n","before I come from a turkic background and I look the part so naturally I was greeted in Turkish by the owner (i think?). I'm thinking ok this is going to be a great place, very authentic.\n","\n","Boy oh boy was I wrong! \n","\n","Mom had the lab kewab, and I had the chicken. Priced very reasonably but I would have been willing to pay a bit more if that means that they can produce a high quality product. Mom said her meat was chewy and hard. I tried a piece and I agreed. My chicken was bland and had a weird texture. \n","\n","The rice which is usually so so tasty at middle eastern\\/turkish restaurants was so lackluster. Sorry Husnus but this food was not authentic in any way.\n","before According to friends Veranda is supposed to be at the same level as Eno Vino--and the person that told us that was SEVERELY mistaken. \n","Eno vino is a classy place with an amazing variety of dishes. \n","Veranda is good in its own right--much more expensive if you're going there for the tapas atmosphere as their tapas are expensive. You're better off ordering off the main menu. \n","We got bruschetta (Yellow Squash with bacon \u0026 gorgonzola, Smoked Salmon dill cream cheese, slivered red onions \u0026 capers, Beef Tenderloin with boursin \u0026 pickled red onion, and Prosciutto \u0026 Fresh Mozzarella, tomato, basil \u0026 balsamic drizzle) which were all great! And one main dish (Rigatoni Veranda Style sliced Italian sausage, fresh mozzarella, olive oil, Roma tomatoes, garlic, pine nuts, olives \u0026 fresh basil in a signature tomato sauce) to split between two. The pasta dish came already split for us in separate plates (much appreciated). We were stuffed and the bill was pretty low! Happy overall with the food and service. Very clean tastes and very true to the flavors of the ingredients. \n","\n","As far as the ambiance, Veranda is certainly trying-the huge gilded mirror is beautiful and their outdoor area seemed pretty (we were indoors). The dishes are beautifully prepared and presented nicely. But the servers and host were all VERY casual. The way that they talked and conducted themselves left us both feeling like the restaurant's staff need to have more training before they can really be a classy place. Right now they are caught in the middle and need a bit more time to really hone their skills.  \n","\n","Besides that our waiter noticed our attire (we were pretty dressed up considering it was a Thursday night) and asked if we were celebrating something--we were, we just got engaged!!-- and he brought out a dessert compliments of Veranda. (Thanks!!) \n","It was a coffee ice cream stuffed inside a biscuit (not sure of the name-sorry) drizzled in some chocolate sauce with cream. It was really rich and great but definitely wasn't fresh, the ice cream was WAY frozen and the biscuit thing was good but a little hard.\n","before Adorable cute family owned and run diner. You can tell everyone there from the staff to the customers have been there for years and know the place like the back of their hand. It's definitely tucked away but it's worth looking for. You get this home-y feeling and all warm and fuzzy inside. Their food isn't bad too ;)\n","before Don't do it. Just don't. You're better of with some frozen boxes out of the freezer section of the grocery store. \n","\n","Our dish was half hot, warm in the middle, and cold on the other side. The dessert was stale and bland. \n","\n","BF was BLOATED like he was in his third trimester and miserable for TWO days after. Ew.\n","before Since this place is known to be a churrascaria I will start my review off with the meats. I am not a fan of \"sweet meats\" aka a meat with any kind of sweet glaze on it. When I went for Sunday brunch the offerings were sausage, flank, and ham. The grilled pineapple--sweet enough already--also had a sweet cinnamon glaze on it. \n","\n","The only redeeming quality were the fresh salad bar and fruits. They also had Wisconsin cheese offerings, nuts, and pastries. Sadly the pastries seemed to have come out of a box from Costco. There was also a buffet of scrambled eggs, bacon, and potatoes. I was really unimpressed by this place but I enjoyed getting my fill of cheap pastries, salad, and potatoes.\n","\n","Decor was nice. I tried booking a reservation through Open Table but the restaurant wasn't available through the website. Odd.\n","\n","Was it worth the $15? Meh. Will I be back? Probably--to try the lunch\\/dinner but probably not for brunch. After all I wasn't able to sample their entire selection of meats.\n","before LOVE their new redesign and renovation!! It looks totally different and WAY classier! It does not look like the stereotypical \"asian restaurant\". I love it when restaurants\\/stores\\/companies REINVEST their money into their own businesses because they have pride in their business. This is definitely a company that takes pride in their business.\n","\n","I always see their employees cleaning or shining utensils. I love shiny utensils! \n","\n","Plus they never rush you...even if you come in 20 min before closing. (sorry about that Saigon!)\n","before They put together their own tea bags based on what you order...that is straight up amaze balls. Also they are open crazy late so we walked in after going  for a stroll after going out for dinner! Loved having some digestive soothing trifecta tea after dinner! \n","\n","PLENTY of seating space! Check out the upstairs level while you're there!\n","before Very prompt and attentive service. We only had dessert but it was a good experience. Loved the decor as it seems to be a bit newer compared to other locations I've been to.\n","before Came here knowing what we wanted but still our sales guy \"dave\" really took care of us here! He was super patient and explained everything from payment options, features of cars, and his personal experiences. When the manager wouldn't go any lower on the price of the car, he even wrote us a personal check to make sure we left satisfied. We did and now a month into owning our new car we are so happy and although we also own a Honda...I gotta say that I think we're Hyundai people now ;)\n","before FUNKY cool place, I loved the food here. Trendy yet classic food options. \n","Bites were a perfect example of this-great spin on a classic kobe beef tartare by adding a raw quail egg yolk on top. (so small though, I wanted more!!!)\n","\n","We enjoyed the duck roll as well as the other \"raw\" rolls as well! \n","The chefs sampler for dessert was an amazing end to our dinner. About 2 samplings of 4 different desserts and I was in heaven! It was just the two of us for dinner but it's ok...we were able to handle the dessert platter ;)\n","before Very, umm, interesting location for this store. Compared to other TJ Maxx locations this one is great because there aren't dust bunnies all over the dressing room. That was ALWAYS my biggest complaint and annoyance when I go to other discount retail stores. \n","Besides the clothes (PLEASE expand the atheletic department!) there is a nice home goods section. I picked up a nice slab of marble and marble coasters for a very low price.\n","before Open late--awesome \n","Very clean! Very nice employees. TVs were playing football games and Disney Channel, so there's something for everyone ;)\n","Small cups available to take at your will to sample the flavors. Only one size for the bowls (super extra large lol) so be careful when filling up on the iced goods because the topping buffet is still waiting...\n","They have really unique toppings like chocolate rocks! I loved that they had nutella as well!\n","My fiance and his friend loaded up and they were each at a whopping 16 oz. It's easy to go a little crazy because everything is so yummy! \n","Their dispensers are really neat as well they have two different flavors on the right and left and the middle is a combo of the two!\n","before This place is a hot mess but I love a good deal so I will be back! It's in a shopping center with a HUGE parking lot and it's right outside of the westtown mall.....I love when all my favorite stores are close to each other!!!\n","\n","As long as you come armed with a shield of patience you will find some cheap, unique items here. They are very similar in their offerings as TJ Maxx (i've been to both in one day and seen many of the same items) BUT Burlington doesn't only carry name brands...they also carry some VERY cheap quality items, especially in the shoes department. \n","\n","I would def. hit up BCF and score some of your basics and (maybe) jewlery before heading to west town mall and investing in some quality pieces.\n","before Huge amount of space and clean facilities--great for big conventions. Parking is only $3 and pretty big parking lots on top of that! It's RIGHT off the highway which is so convenient!\n","before Maybe it was the timing...but I had the worst experience of my life and I've had some pretty bad nail salon experiences.\n","\n","Although I want to shout and shake my fist, instead I'll give some constructive criticism:\n","\n","*invest in bigger UV drier for gel nails (not one that fits only 4 fingers) and one that has a longer setting than 30 seconds\n","* DON'T' ALLOW OTHER CUSTOMERS TO PLAY THEIR OWN MUSIC FROM THEIR PHONES!!!!!!!!! Seriously!!\n","*Don't tell people that you can accommodate their services when you obviously can't\n","* Where is your price list? \n","*invest in actual, legitimate signs that are professionally printed. Not something written with a sharpie\n","*don't loudly announce what someone left another technician for tip\n","*don't let the employees and owner\\/manager have their cell phone ringer on high and actually take phone calls.\n","*don't have someone take their shoes off and stick their feet in a bath while you call on your cell phone while you are doing my nails to come and take care of this other customer's service. \n","*don't let your employees perform services while their hair are in rollers\n","*ASK YOUR CUSTOMERS IF THEY WANT THEIR NAILS SHORTER AND WHAT SHAPE THEY WANT IT IN. \n","*don't try and serve two customers at the same time (I ended up refiling my own nails on one hand...and then the second time she left me I had to dry my own nails under the UV and reset the timer on it every 30 seconds)\n","*DON'T FILE SOMEONE ELSE'S ACRYLIC NAILS, GET THE ACRYLIC DUST ALL OVER YOUR HANDS AND ARMS, AND THEN IMMEDIATELY PUMP LOTION ON YOUR HAND AND GIVE ME A \"HAND MASSAGE\" THAT IS GRITTY FROM ALL OF THE ACRYLIC DUST FROM SOMEONE ELSE'S NAILS.\n","before Best burger in Madison:\n","\n","HMMMMMMMMMMM\n","\n","It was PACKED and crazy....but that was right AFTER we got seated! Make sure to come early if it's game day so you can get a seat. ;)\n","\n","We have eaten enough in Madison to know that there are a few hidden gems that deserve to be recognized nationally. That being said when we heard that DDD's was voted the best like 100 years in a row we had to check it out. \n","\n","We ordered a burger each, jambalaya \"soup\" as an appetizer and a regular order of chili fries. \n","First of all WOW the regular order of chili fries was humongous. That was really unexpected. It was also unexpected that it took so long to order and it  arrived ridiculously late. \n","Secondly I had ordered the California burger and which was supposed to come with a whole bunch of toppings that sounded amazing on the menu but when I got it I literally had to remove the top bun to make sure that I got the right burger because I didn't taste half the toppings. \n","\n","I have been to \"gourmet\" burgers joints before and have loved every second of them. I however did not find justification in spending $8+ for a sliver of a burger with very dismal amount of toppings. (was that burger patty even 4 ounces??)\n","before If you like salty food--this is the place to go!! \n","I love that they have a VISION and they stick to it from the food to the decor! The BF had to order two burgers to feel full and I would have too but the fries I ordered (I've had them before at a yelp event and they were MUCH better back then) left a salty taste in my mouth so I held off.\n","\n","Food came out really quickly and we both loved our burgers:DLUX, White fish, and backyard BBQ! His fish burger was AMAZING and I wish I had ordered it, but I loved mine as well. \n","\n","The Blue cheese and bacon fries have been delicious in the past but I didn't like them this time...I'll be back to try again though!!\n","before Great old school grocery store. They have pretty great prices on produce and they are my \"go to\" for a bunch of different products. They have two lanes just for organic products which is pretty extensive. They carry a lot of my favorite \"specialty products\" which is just amazing. There is a huge selection of cards and they have a humongous alcohol selection which is a whole separate store attached to the main store. \n","\n","Had to knock two stars off because:\n","1. decor and shelf set up is just so outdated and not appealing. It's depressing\n","2. they don't accept and credit cards! Boo!\n","before Came here after purchasing a Livingsocial offer for their intro workshop. It was easy enough to register and find a time suitable for me. They also offered a $15 discount if you signed up for a course right after the workshop, I did and I'm excited to start class in a few weeks!\n","\n","I'm not a fan that all of their class times are after work hours (starting at 5, 6, or 7pm) as I would much rather come in earlier. But not a deal breaker. I'm also not a fan that the entire wall wasn't covered in mirrors. A big part of pole dancing is the visual aspect of it so I would prefer to have more mirrors. Again, not a deal breaker.\n","\n","Between the cheap rate for the course, decently sized parking lot (its in a shopping center) and the fact that the studio is less than 10 minutes away from my apartment I'm excited to have found this place and I'll add another review after my course with them is over.\n","before The only thing I like about chains: consistency.\n","\n","At a buck per doughnut it is steeper than what's offered elsewhere. \n","\n","This location has a drive through-not sure how I feel about that. I mean you should at least get out of your car and walk up to get your doughnut, but that's just a personal opinion. If it's working I guess people want it and maybe some Yelpers will be interested to know that.\n","before Sundance cinema is also a part of the Hilldale shopping center which apparently features a few big name movies but mostly indie films. $9.50 base fee for all tickets and an extra surcharge based on the time of the day and the type of film.\n","They have a neat bar offering coffee\\/sandwiches\\/wine\\/beer all to be enjoyed outside in the lounge area featuring really lovely leather couches and rustic wooden tables. If you are there to enjoy a movie you can take the food and drink inside the theater as well. They don't offer typical movie fare, but stuff more along the lines of artisan sandwiches. \n","\n","I didn't watch a movie but the outside lounge area was very spacious and if not for a movie I'll be back to enjoy a coffee and the large grey leather couch ;)\n","before Cute local place-they seem to have their regulars as the lady behind the cash register was on a first name basis with some of the store perusers.\n","\n","I will say that some of the people in the store looked like they were straight out of honey boo boo child ;)\n","\n","Bascially the gist of the store is that they offer home style cooking frozen and packaged up. They have options like pizza crusts to chicken pot pies. All come with defrosting and cooking instructions. \n","\n","There were a ton of samples of their offerings. I was only tempted by one-and it was a sampling of chips and guac. It's my impression that samples are to show your patrons the quality of your food, and tempt them in to purchasing your goods.  However the chips were stale and the guac was off as well. Disappointing. \n","\n","I didn't purchase anything because the price points for everything were so ridiculous. Additionally for a store that is offering home style cooking to take home I would hope that they would have offered cleaner, more nutritious foods, maybe some local sourced produce\\/meat but I didn't see anything of the sorts. Again, disappointing. \n","\n","\n","Great concept but there are some kinks that need to be worked out before I visit again.\n","before BEWARE: SERVING SIZES ARE GINORMOUS!\n","\n","We did not know this^^ and over-ordered!! Next time the BF and I are splitting a plate of pasta! \n","Calamari appetizer was SO inexpensive and SO much food! In fact I think all their dishes are underpriced for the quantity that you get. This was the most delicious app I have had--so flavorful and so FRESH! \n","On top of the calamari we also got the sausage pasta and the seafood pasta. Both had heaping amounts of food and delicious in their own sense. We were seafood-ed out after the appetizer so we were devouring the sausage pasta. The sauce for the sausage pasta was amazing--we took the noodles from the seafood dish and dunked it in the other plate's sauce to drink it all up :)\n","before This is your typical WF. I was bribed to come here through a Yelp check in offer. Not a great one but when there are a lot of options for grocers in the area it makes a difference. \n","\n","The offer was for a free small tote and they only had a full size. Customer service was nice enough and they allowed me to have it. \n","\n","Their prices on meats are ridiculously higher compared to similar stores. Prices on non organic produce are also higher.\n","\n","WF has a few specialty products that some other stores of the similar line don't carry and that would be the only reason that I would go back.\n","before All you can eat for under $10........what is there to complain about?? If you want junk food and you want lots of it oh this is THE place to go! \n","You've got several hungry mouths to feed and  not that much $$ in the wallet....then this is THE place to go.\n","Other than that I'm not sure why you would go here....\n","before Very beautiful area with 8+ food trucks during the lunch rush and lots of benches to enjoy your food on! Surrounded by lovely gothic architecture to look at and tall trees providing shade....it can be a really serene place to relax. Of course sometimes there are events going on here and a random hardcore religious advocate shouting at the crowd.\n","before Unenthusiastic barista but the other patrons were on a first name basis with him so maybe it was b\\/c I'm a newbie :) Also the manager of the TCBY next door came over and they were all laughing up a storm....I can handle chit chat (I've worked retail before so I'm not too harsh) but when there is a customer right there in front of you sometimes it's better to postpone the conversation a few minutes until they walk away. \n","\n","Anyways; I got a hazelnut coffee and the beans were ground up right there and brewed on the spot. I don't know if this is normal (I have never had a cup of coffee brewed especially for me before) but I felt special and made up for what was experienced in the above paragraph :) The coffee was a bit weak. That in combo with the lack luster barista I had to knock off a star. \n","\n","They also had a long list of italian sodas that they offer and I will have to come back and try one of those out as well!\n","before I have been to many a asian mart in my day but this place is really the epitome of the stereotype of an asian mart. \n","\n","There are no windows in the bulk of the store and the windows in the front are all covered up......I have no idea why..........\n","\n",".......still wondering why.........\n","\n","Moving on, I can see the appeal of this store as they do carry 13208923874820983534 brands of oriental specialty items like all of the candies, snacks, dried food, teas, etc. This place is packed from ceiling to the ground and the aisles were just afterthoughts! \n","\n","The produce section was borderline scary and I would never buy produce from there. With the amount of people that were in there when I was there I would think that they would have enough money to expand....or at least brighten the place up a bit!!! There wasn't too many things in the produce section that I wouldn't be able to find in another grocery store, although I'm pretty sure they would never be as cheap at another place!\n","\n","Disappointed that they didn't carry any oriental dishes\\/cups\\/teapots\\/platters\\/etc.\n","\n","I wouldn't come back unless I was in DIRE need of something that I couldn't find anywhere else...the way that the store is kept is really a reflection of the owners interest in it....and this place is seriously depressing.\n","before SO easy to miss....actually I did...twice!!! \n","\n","I was headed there for an impromptu birthday dinner for a friend and walked by twice.....do they have a sign on the front??? Because I didn't see anything!! Finally one of those dry erase boards out front caught my eye and I saw there written in green marker \"Diego's\". \n","\n","Really though?\n","\n","Anyways, made it in and it has a casual atmosphere. There's a long bar and high tables in the front and towards the back are the actual tables and chairs. That's where we sat for our meal. It seems like people in my group enjoyed their food thought I heard that the enchiladas weren't spectacular. I had the ceviche appetizer which was pretty filling!!! \n","\n","Unfortunately for us we were there the friday before halloween and I'm not sure if this is normal but a DJ set up in the corner across from us and started pumping out some songs.....then the waiters stacked up all of the chairs and tables as people finished and left. Soon enough our table was the last one left on that entire half side of the restaurant. It was awkward for us because some of us were still finishing up our drinks...a friend had just bought a pitcher when we broke away from our conversation long enough to realize that were the only table left.\n","\n","No one bothered us to finish faster and when we finally did get up the manager (i think) came over and apologized for rushing us and brought over a round of drinks for our group of 6!\n","\n","Very smooth Manager ;) \n","\n","But next time we'll be heading here for dinner a little bit earlier just in case that's a regular friday night event.\n","before Cute corner shop across form the mall. \n","Consistent service like you would expect from Starbucks.\n","before Love this comedy club- not a fan of their 2 drink minimum but glad there isn't a $$ minimum per table. It's is always PACKED when we go...just a testament that they have performers that are funny as f*%#\u0026!!!!! ;) \n","\n","Even the \"opening acts\" have all been awesome!!!\n","before Great selection of products and also a 15% check in offer? Can't beat that! I see in a lot of the reviews that they are very picky with what they decide to consign. And they are doing a great job at it based on the high quality products they had in store. \n","\n","I love how they divide the different types of clothing separating the designer from the vintage from the regular tops\\/bottoms. I think that's genius so that you can search based on what you're looking for. \n","\n","I was a bit disappointed by their handbag selection but that isn't their fault-I haven't seen to many Gucci bags being carried around Madison so obviously there aren't too many that are consigning them either. \n","\n","I left with a cute Zara dress for later on in the Fall and an eclectic belt. I'll definitely be back to check out any new items in a few weeks!\n","before We have used Todd's Car Service two times this year already and have been very happy with the service, it really is 5 star, the other review's are spot on.  From start to finish he gives a professional service and fair pricing.\n","\n","When we booked it we received a confirmation email with all of Todd's contact info and our pickup\\/drop-off locations.  Our pickup was early morning and Todd arrived on time, he was nice enough have orange juice, water, and granola bars for us to snack on for our hour long trip....very nice touch.  His SUV was new and clean, it has several TV's and touch screen's to use while we were traveling across town.  Our return trip was just as nice and hassle free.\n","\n","We will continue to call Todd anytime we are traveling to an event around Phoenix or if we have clients who are needing transportation.\n","before I've used Doug to faux a movie room and it looks fantastic.  He used a metallic glaze over a reddish base and I couldn't be happier.  We also had a room with wallpaper, the wallpaper had a small tear in it, rather than removing the wallpaper we had Doug faux paint the tear to match the existing wallpaper, you literally cannot even see the mark.  We'll use Doug again for our next projects.\n","before Went back here again and purchased a dresser for our new baby.  We love it and will go back again IF we have another kid.\n","before Customer service is dead these days, and Century Link is a prime example of this.  We used to have DirectTV but switched over to Century Link Prism TV when our DTV contract was up.  What a hassle, I thought DTV customer service was bad......Century Link is 10x worse.  Bills are wrong every time and speaking with customer service is a total nightmare.  Expect to spend over an hour getting anything changed.\n","\n","We called to add a second receiver, they missed two appointments and I sat at home all day each time waiting for them.  Each time I called to explain the situation they were clueless, even when I gave them my confirmation number.  When I asked for a free month or something for my time wasted sitting at home all day they refused.\n","\n","They assured me it would be done Monday....we'll see.\n","before We've been going here for a few years and he's the only mechanic we trust.  We take all our commercial as well as my personal vehicles here.  I cringe at the thought of having to take my cars somewhere else because I just know Jeff will be honest and I'm not sure about the other companies out there.\n","before Jim from JPG Home Security came by today and inspected our house for a new security alarm.  He was very knowledgeable and straight forward on what types of alarms and sensors our home needed to protect our family.  Knowing he was previously in law enforcement it was neat to get an \"inside view\" of how criminals work and how we can combat their tactics. \n","\n","We had previously been setup with ADT but it was setup wrong and wasn't completely keeping us safe.  Thankfully, Jim got us all setup correctly and we are glad we used him.  We even were able to get a new keypad that works with our cell phone, something we really liked.\n","\n","Being a business owner myself, I can really tell when an owner is ethical and trustworthy and Jim and his company definitely fit that description.  I'm going to recommend him to any of our friends or family who are interested in home protection or alarm systems.\n","before The good: Very nice setup, amazing view, the chip ball technology, the game setup, TV's in each bay, music\\/lighting.\n","\n","The OK:  Food was just OK, I can't help but relate it to being at the Brunswick Zone XL, it was good but not amazing.\n","\n","The bad:  Price.  We were there for 2 hours with 3 people, we golfed and ate, it was $225.  I understand if we're on a nice N. Scottsdale course and we spend $100+ a pop for a round of golf and some drinks but to spend this much at a driving range just doesn't seem right.  I most closely relate this to high-class bowling and I can't see spending this much on a regular basis.\n","\n","TIP:  Don't hit it too far, if you hit over the net they will know it was your ball that broke that car window.  This didn't happen to us but that is what they mentioned.  It seems impossible but a 250 yard high drive will do it.\n","before Miguel game out same day to give a quote.  Straight to the point, couldn't ask for more.  He only tried to sell us what we needed not what cost the most.  I will hire them in the fall once it cools down.  Miguel is onsite on each job which means alot to me.\n","before We've been in the market for several weeks looking for the right bar stools to fit in our built in BBQ.  I've been trying to find a used set but just can't find the right size.  There are not too many patio stores in the East valley so our options were limited and nobody had the size we needed.  \n","\n","I went into the store on a Tuesday and spoke with the owner Dan, he was very knowledgeable and helpful when I explained our odd sized BBQ.  He helped me size out just the right stools to fit it perfectly and even recommended the ones with no arms so that they wouldn't knock on our uniquely low bar top.\n","\n","I was pleased with the size, style, and price so I bought 4 of them.  We also had purchased custom Sunbrella cushions from another local shop and Dan was able to match the fabric exactly and he is having them made for us.  The chairs came a few days later and the cushions will be done in a few weeks (its the busy season).  Dan was nice enough to give us temporary ones to use until ours come in.\n","\n","I'm thankful we found this place and next time we're in need of anything we'll definitely drop by here first.\n","before We love this place.  They really make you feel welcome and at home here.  They go out of their way to invite you into many of their other classes.   All around just a great place to be a member.\n","before Steve and his team removed an old truck wrap for us, designed a new one and applied it to our truck, it looks fantastic.  The process was great from the first meeting to the final product.  We have worked with a different wrap company in the past and I can say the customer service from Cortez was great and moving forward they have earned our business for the rest of our fleet.  They also went above and beyond with our logo to give it an updated look for the new wrap, we will be using this on our other advertising we like it so much.\n","before Had them out to replace a water heater as well as install a new soft water system.  Ben came out to do the bid, he was prompt and professional.  He also suggested I replace my front water spigot as it was leaky.  I ended up hiring them a few days later and they did the work that next week.  The piping and welding looks clean and it was very easy on my part.  Its been about 2 months since its been completed and we've had no issues.\n","\n","They are coming back at the 6 month point to drain the water heater which I like so I don't need to think about it.\n","before Make sure you signup for their email list, you'll get 20-30% off coupons each week, then it makes going here a great deal for name brand clothing.\n","before Went there looking for a used receptionist desk and ended up leaving feeling like we were bothering the salesperson.  When we walked in the place seemed nice and had lots of options.  We browsed the new area and saw there was a back warehouse with a sign that said \"come in\" so we walked through the used area and saw some possible options we could purchase.  Pricing seemed fair for the used furniture and we saw a few pieces of interest.  When the sales person came out and asked us if we needed help she seemed very annoyed that we were there.  She made it feel like we were bothering her and she didn't have time for us.  When we inquired about different options and what they had in stock (the sign on several items said more in stock) she said those are old signs and she doesn't know what they have.  When we asked her to check she just seemed more annoyed and acted like she had better stuff to do.  We saw a nice desk but I don't do business with people who act like they don't need it or want it so off to the next place.\n","before I've been coming here for over 2 years.  I can honestly say it's the best gym I've ever been a member of.  This is the place where everyone knows your name, it's what initially kept me coming even though I was to sore to move.  All the instructors are very knowledgeable and seem to care about each person completing the workout with proper form.\n","before Finding a quality computer technician in today's world is honestly harder than you would think.  We've been through several tech's and lately I've been forced to do all our upgrades personally.  Finally, I stumbled on  Big Byte Computers.  I had them upgrade the RAM and hard drives in our server for our company.  It was an unusual situation as they were dealing with a 12 year old computer.  Michael was great, he was very helpful in offering solutions on areas we are able to upgrade with the old computer.  We opted to install 2 separate 1 TB drives (1 as a backup) and then some additional RAM.  Since we use our server 6 days a week they were able to do after hours work (at add'l cost) and work late Saturday to upgrade the entire system.  I picked it up from them Sunday morning and I could't be happier.  They delivered what they promised and went above and beyond by working off hours for us.\n","\n","I'll go to them for all our future computer needs.  Michael has been very helpful.\n","before Not well lit and if you get hurt by their equipment they will not take responsibility.  It was dark in one area of their gaming room and my mother tripped over one of their arcade games.  She unfortunately fell and broke her arm and had a badly bloody nose.  When we went to get a manager they only offered a  paper towel.....they didnt even seem concerned at all.  We took her to the hospital and her arm was broken from the fall.  Main Event took absolutely no responsibility and will not help with any of her medical bills at all.\n","before This salon is absolutely FABULOUS.  After experiencing less than acceptable service at salons I was somewhat hesitant to believe a  referral.  Well all doubts quickly passed as I was greeted and my services rendered. I experienced a series of firsts... To name a few... 1) I made an appointment, it was honored and confirmed with my name and phone number, 2) I was offered a bottle of water on arrival, 3) The BASIC pedigree included a hot rock massage, 4) I received acknowledgment and a coupon for being a first time customer and 5) All services were priced accordingly - no nickel and diming or hidden extras. The staff and owners were friendly and accommodating and they are VERY Clean.  They even use disposable liners in the spa chairs. The cherry on top - NO CHICK-LET NAILS! (To provide a point of reference - I have natural nails but my previous manicure gave the impression I had acrylics. can you say THICK). This place is great - unlike any nail shop I have been in in AGES! They have upped the bar for my expectations.\n","before Went to hang out with some friends Saturday night. Got there around 10 or so. Was not busy, got seated quickly. However, service here is lacking greatly (as it was when the place was called Cleopatras) and is VERY SLOWWWWW. Waited 23 minutes for a cranberry\\/vodka and over an hour for food\\/hookah. I don't think I even tasted vodka in my cran\\/vodka. I didn't feel like complaining since I knew it would take forever to get another one. The hummus with meat was decent, bread was kinda dry and hard. Don't expect too much when you come. It's too bad Bc this place has the potential to be so great! Maybe they need better management.\n","before By far the best mechanic shop in town! I've followed Fred and Liberty automotive through all his locations in Phoenix. When you find an honest mechanic, you stick with them! Fred and his team make sure my car is running in tip top condition and don't try to up sell me for other services! Even when they are busy they always make sure to keep me posted on how long it will be and if I'm not able to wait, I can either leave the car there or schedule time with him another day. I've never been disappointed in the service I've received! I would recommend Fred and Liberty automotive to everyone like I already have. :)\n","before Mr appliance was awesome! We had an issue with our ice maker in the refrigerator and mr appliance was there to help us out. Chase H, in specific, was fantastic! He was prompt, courteous, knowledgeable and super nice! Got our ice maker back up and running in no time. I would recommend them-especially Chase- in a heartbeat! Thanks so much!\n","before Great food. Quality ingredients. Simple menu. Their fries are kinda bland unless you do them animal style. The place is always busy! I wish there was easier access into this location too.\n","before I have made two trips here, mainly because both times I went, they weren't busy at all. First time was to remove gel manicure and just do a regular manicure. Nathan was pleasant and kind. Unfortunately, the polish chipped off of 3 nails on the same day. My second trip here I got the #1 pedicure. There was literally no one in the salon other than 2 employees playing on their phone, so I was seen right away. The water I was soaking my feet in was kind of cold. The gal doing my nails cut me twice while she was clipping my cuticles. Nail polish also chipped within a day or two. The staff was friendly though.\n","before Since I moved to Glendale, I come here mainly for my nail services. They're usually pretty busy, but worth the wait as service is great. I will say that Andy can be kind of rude sometimes though, but my nails look fantastic. Lots of color options, priced decent and they're clean.\n","before I moved to the area about a year ago and this is definitely my go to place for good pizza. Being a transplanted NYer now living in the desert, it's hard to find good pizza. It makes me mad when I see all these lousy places advertising \"NY style pizza\" when it's a bunch of lies. I love Stevie's pizza! They're about as close to NY style pizza I can get outside of New York! ANDDDD they have garlic knots! Yum to the max! I also love the decor in the restaurant- lots of canvas prints of NY. Very cool. Thumbs up from me!\n","before If you want a crappy, messy job. Reymundo is your guy. He is a CON MAN. We bought a house at the end of March. Got his number through another contractor. Had him come out to measure and give me an estimate for granite work in the house (2.5 bathrooms, and kitchen). After 3 failed appointments, he finally showed up and gave me an estimate as said the work would be done in 7-10 days. Ok no problem. 3 weeks later and my granite still wasn't installed. Lots of phone calls, text messages, and voicemails and I still didn't have my granite. He finally got back in touch with me to install it at the end of April. Everything was installed so I finished paying him in full. I noticed the same night that there was a crack down the middle of the sink in the master bath. I called him and informed him about it and he said no problem he will have a replacement in 3 days. Here we are in JUNE and he still hasn't come back to replace it. He sparingly responds back to any of my calls\\/messages and when he does its \"let me call you back later this week\". At one time he even gave me a date of when he would install, and my husband and I both took the day off to make sure we were available for him and he never showed up.  He is a con man and if you wanna be ripped off, give him a call. I would give him no stars if Yelp allowed it. What a jerk.\n","before I love love love this place! Great service and the staff is super knowledgeable and kind! I love all the suggestions and recommendations they've given me so far! Ben is super friendly and really knows his stuff! Steven was very attentive and sociable! The hookah is the smoothest I've ever smoked! Xhale has a ton of supplies for hookah enthusiasts. Ben even helped me fix one of my hookahs. The lounge is updated and definitely a great spot to chill and hang out with friends or even solo! I'll definitely be back again soon! 10\\/10 would def recommend this place to anyone!\n","before Great experience! Went cake tasting for our wedding and Jessica was a huge help!! She brought out the tastings for us after giving us time to look through their amazing book. She explained every cake and filling and had great recommendations for mixing the fillings. The champagne cake with cream cheese filling was amazing!! Chose our cake and design within an hour. Great service and knowledge. Thank you Jessica!\n","before Love coming here. Nicole has been doing my hair and my son's hair for about 5 years now. She is very polite and takes her time. I will continue on coming here.\n","before I'm so happy that I was introduced to the McHenry's martial arts studio. My son has grown over the past few years and I have also grown since starting my training again. I would recommend this place to anyone who is looking for a place to train.\n","before I got the Super 8. It's $9.95 and has 2 Pancakes, 2 bacon, 2 sausage, eggs any style and home fries. It wasn't too bad it's pretty greasy. The sausages are clearly deep fried, but kind of good. The coffee is $1.50 free refills it's kind of mediocre. It's not very busy at all. It's definitely a place we could come back to. Oh and they take debit that's always a plus. They have a tv here too, the jays game was on.\n","before We went to eat there last night. We called ahead of time to ask to reserve a table (we had a party of 9). They said that they had a table for us. Not even a 5 minute ride we get there and they told us the wait was 30 minutes and that they didn't save the table. We finally get our table and the service was soooooo slow. We had to flag down a waiter just to get our drink orders after sitting there for 20 minutes. We did all you can eat, which the food was so delicious. We had to flag a waiter every time we need something then remind them 20 minutes later.  The whole dinner process was about two hours just because the service was slow. The food though, was delicious and I will probably just order take out next time instead of waiting, what seemed like forever, for our next plate to come out.\n","before Worst hotel I've ever been to.Staff, for the most part were okay. Parking was a nightmare, first morning we woke up to being blocked in 3 cars deep on all sides.Took 2 hours to get the car out of the lot. Although to my understanding, it's the owner's idea to sell out the lot to public, but the staff member we had to deal with was also pretty rude. He had a difficult customer at one point and he started screaming at him, all I could hear was his voice. Customer wasn't even yelling.. They started knocking on doors for people to move their car so other people could get out of the lot at 6am, so yeah people were upset. Rooms were okay, bed was kinda made terribly, 2 pillows on one bed were okay, but other bed had like travel pillows, not sure why. Breakfast included a minimal amount of food \u0026 they ran out of utensils, but i'm just happy breakfast was free. Would never come here again. We booked 3 nights but only stayed one due to how awful our experience was. --- this is an edit, we had to stay the night here again due to our relatives (in LV) having plans to go out of town and we had already paid for the room x3 days, so whatever, we'll just park our car in a parking space that looks easily accessible and hope for the best. Well at 1AM, staff comes knocking on our door... telling us we're blocking someone in. Someone so happened to pull in behind us and a bunch of cars blocked them in. We, of course, got up and moved our car only to be blocked in the next morning, courtesy of the housekeeper. We complained to the manager and he straight up gave us attitude, very sarcastic man. He offered $20 off total price we paid which probably wasn't even worth it, but we took it anyway and got out of there\n","before Authentic Irish pub with cool Irish owners. This place makes me happy. I'm very grateful to have an old fashion pub nearby without the gross bar fly drunks that make you feel dirty. If you're looking for a place to hang out with your friends, this is the perfect place.\n","before I have been back a few times since that first fateful day. I am confused as to the pricing of the Cleveland Bagel. The first time I bought them here, they were $1.50 per bagel. For some reason when I recently went, my receipt showed that I was charged $1.75 a bagel. I am wondering what changed? It was about 2 weeks later when I noticed the price difference. Another thing that occurred to me was that I felt like the most recent turkey sandwich I had there was different from my first encounter. Are they using different turkey now?\n","before This was obviously just not my atmosphere, I would say. It might suit a small portion of the population of high school students or maybe freshman and sophomores in college. After that, no thank you. It has been years since I've been here but I remember the place even now--as one to which I would not return. It was kind of greasy and grimy. Dark and dreary. \n","\n","Put nicely, Chuck \n","E Cheese is Camelot compared to this establishment. Actually, I like Chuck E Cheese.  \n","\n","I do not recall the food enough to comment on it except to say it was unmemorable.\n","\n","How in G-d's name is this place still open?\n","\n","After reading the other reviews, it's clear this place needs an intervention the likes of which could only be pulled off by a fairy godmother.\n","before This is the best coffee in Cleveland. I also sampled their Bailey's drink today and can verify it is out of this world delicious. Go here.\n","before I had today's special from the Global Grill, which was shrimp skewers. It came with grilled corn on the cob, basmati (I believe that was the type) rice, and a stalk of grilled green onion. I used a $2 off coupon, so the total came to $8.99. I must say, this was a good deal. There were six large shrimp grilled to perfection and skewered in groups of three on my plate, along with a generous portion of deliciously seasoned rice--(seasoned I should say with some kind of piquant sauce that made it more than tasty). The corn tasted fresh and was grilled right. The only thing about the downtown location that can be a problem is parking. But I was able to find a free spot on the street near the store today at around 5pm.\n","before I went to the New Year's Eve party that took place at The Vault downstairs and had a wonderful experience. I arrived early (8pm) because I had not pre-purchased a ticket for the party which was said to be sold out. I called and spoke with a kind woman ahead of time, and she recommended showing up early and waiting to see if there was a possibility of getting in. \n","\n","I did--and there was. Prior to going to the downstairs affair which included appetizers (crab cakes, asian egg roll type things, and bruschetta), I went upstairs to a well-appointed small bar. They didn't have one of the ingredients for the coffee drink I wanted to order, so it was suggested I consider a chocolate martini, which I did. It was excellent--with a red raspberry on the rim of the glass. My only qualm was that this drink was $3 more than the coffee drink I wanted to order, and I was not told about this ahead of time. So--$3--that's fine. Not a big deal obviously, but still it would have been nice to know prior to ordering. \n","\n","As for the party downstairs, it was great. The people at this place are professional. Thank you for a wonderful New Year's Eve party. If I lived out of town, I would stay at this hotel.\n","before I took out a French onion soup tonight. Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh. Amazing. The broth was perfectly and heavily peppered--which made it even more divine. If there was a drop of water in this broth, I did not taste it. It was rich and full-bodied. The take-out version comes in two smallish sized containers, each bearing a slice of (French?) bread soaked in the heavenly broth. Add this soup to my list of favorites on the West side.\n","before I still give their food the top score. I had the tom yum soup again, followed by a delicious tofu and vegetables dish which was served in a nouveau style--on a flat rectangular plate, with a pyramid tower of rice. The dish had avocados, red and green peppers, onions and carrots and was heaven to the palette. \n","  \n","I was there during the busy lunch hour when the place was packed.\n","before I enjoy The Root Cafe in general, and have been enjoying it since soon after moving here in May 2011. I found out about the place through a cop. I was shopping or something in Lakewood and figured if anyone knew where the good coffee was in a particular area, it would be a police officer. I asked an officer who was standing around the stores where the best coffee in Lakewood could be found, and he directed me to The Root Cafe. Originally he directed me toward a fancy kind of coffee, I was thinking, because of the way he described this special filter for the coffee--a cone-like object that some people will be familiar with or know what I'm talking about--like the thing that you put the coffee filter in on a coffee maker. Not a french press but a more regular-looking thing. Anyway it turned out when I went to The Root Cafe and asked one of the employees about which kind of coffee the cop might have been describing that was so good, she told me he meant just their regular coffee--less expensive than the kind prepared using the special filter thing I described before. So I got a cup of regular. Indeed it was good coffee. Not necessarily the best, but good. \n","\n","I also enjoy the food at The Root. They have delicious molasses cookies, and the vegetarian dishes--they are all vegetarian--are satisfying enough that one might think there was some meat\\/protein-based item snuck into their sandwiches. After I eat something there, I am full.  \n","\n","The only downside to this place is if you want to have an audible conversation and you go at one of the times of the week when they have a band. I went with a friend one time when they had what I thought was a sort of bluegrass band playing, and I could not hold a conversation so we ended up leaving pretty much upon arrival.\n","before I really like this place. The vegan bar was delicious. I detected cranberries, oatmeal and cinnamon in the bar, among other ingredients. I also had a caramel-vanilla steamer which was tasty. \n","\n","The best reason to come here is the people though. The three individuals who were here when I came to Cafe-Ah-Roma were Brian, Matt and Sarah. They were all very kind and willing to help me when I got lost and missed my Hebrew tutoring session.\n","before Oh my goodness--the happy hour here is amazing! Such a deal for such delicioso chompings. I loved their sophisticated mac and cheese and everything else I sampled somewhat recently, though not recently enough, for me to provide a full-tilt boogie review. The wine was excellent--I recall that I had Riesling that fateful night not so long ago. And dessert--I must've--I did-- stick around for that crowning jewel of any meal--it was fabulous\n"," indeed.\n","before The peanut butter-banana-caramel shake I had yesterday was spectacular!\n","before I'm gonna update my review from the last time and have to say that while the food quality has remained stellar, the service quality has gone down. Allow me to elaborate: when I visited a year ago, the individuals who were behind the counter treated me like a customer, which is to say--they cared. Now, based on the past few times I have visited, the customer seems to have become an afterthought. Which is to say, as the other Yelper who has commented on this place rightly asserted, it seemed as though my presence was an inconvenience to the staff. I did not feel welcome.\n","before This unassuming place is off what I would describe as a nondescript street in Westlake. I went to SB Eightone for a pre-Valentine's suaree, a \"shred your ex\" suaree to be exact. It was purportedly a singles event where one could bring a photo of an old ex to shred in their paper shredding machine. The reward in exchange for your photo was a shiny new ticket for $10 off of your bill--not a bad reward if you ask me. I did not know what to expect as I was not familiar with the town or the restaurant. I was pleasantly surprised. The food was excellent--I tried a risotto\\/marinara dish and it did not disappoint. It was bold, bursting with tomatoey flavor. I also had a warm mushroom salad that was yum. It had some very tasty herb dressing on it and the whole epicurean experience was complete. I look forward to my return.\n","before What can you really say about the RTA? First off, this is no California. It's also no NY, DC, Seattle, and so on. You're in Cleveland--and it's gritty. The airport train is a good deal and it takes you all the way to Tower City if you want to go that far. Also, if you do go that far, you can transfer to a green or blue line train to take you out to the east side. \n","\n","As for the bus service, it's hit or miss. I've had great bus drivers who are funny and kind and helpful. I've also had mean ones who have insulted my intelligence. But back to the great drivers--one of my best experiences was when a driver let me \"interview\" her at Tower City and then accompany her on her route. It was pretty cool.\n","before Creme brûlée cupcake: my reaction after consumption = How. Do. They. Do. It? \n","\n","It is so delicious I have to temper myself and make sure to only buy small quantities.\n","\n","It's magic.\n","before I was back for an event at Townhall, and what an improvement! I enjoyed soft tacos with veggies and tofu. They were stellar. Guacamole was served at this particular event as well along with chips. Tasty guac, light and crisp chips. On this same visit, I ordered a carrot\\/orange juice from the juice bar, and it was delicious. Very good experience this time at Townhall. And the best part--I won four $25 gift certificates to enjoy the restaurant in the future!\n","before This is my go-to Starbucks. Because of the multi-level layout, I usually have a few options of where to sit, and my favorite place is the main level. There are two tables, one of which facilitates easy-access to one's laptop without discomfort--to those of us dealing with back issues, this is great. The baristas are kind. I recommend.\n","before I'll start out by saying I'm hyper flexible, so I tend to have problems with utilizing some of my limbs (read--hands and thumbs) without getting injured. The downward dog is not my friend I daresay. I need to adjust the pose so that I'm leaning on my elbows and arms instead of my hands. The class was somewhat advanced for a beginner like myself, but if you already know what you are doing, I think this would be a good place to go. The instructor told me I would be better served by doing a private class due to my flexibility issues. I am afraid of injuries, and I agree. I was told that Hatha (sp?) yoga would be the best type to do, as opposed to whatever brand of yoga we practiced at the Yelp event for Best of Cleveland.\n","before I visited today for the second time and feel like the vibe here is perfect. The people who run this shop are friendly and made me feel welcome as I sat at the counter where a cool yellow phone from another era (i.e. 80s or earlier) sat. I ordered the dark sourdough with goat cheese ($5 for two thick slices with ample amounts of goat cheese slathered on each). It was delicious, filling and reminded me of similar cuisine I had at a museum restaurant in another city recently.\n","before This place is AWESOME. You must go here. I ordered two fish tacos yesterday and they were outstandingly delicious--fresh, flavorful, lime wedges provided on the side. It was $8 and it was the best meal I've had all week probably. I also enjoyed tasting two wines--one a Riesling, the other a Rose--at the wine stations they have in this store. The service is second-to-none. The people who work here are the best. Go immediately, I implore.\n","before It's awesome. I got a vegan sandwich to take out and it was loaded with marinated eggplant, olives, greens and other morsels of tastiness. I had a salted dark chocolate chip cookie with it. Like the sandwich, the cookie also came loaded--this time with chocolate chunks. The cookie was not soft, rather it had a nice crunch as I bit into it, which I really liked. It was amply sized as well, which pleased me.\n","before I'm sorry. I am just not a dive-bar type of person. I recall the dog I ate at Happy Dog quite some time ago was good. I mean, it's a hot dog, what do you want? \n","\n","I do not go for the atmosphere of the Dog because it just sort of drags me down. It is not cheerful at all. Not that a dive bar attempts to be cheerful, but still, this place sort of puts me down in the dumps in terms of my emotional response. So there, I said it. \n","\n","Three stars based on nice staff and good dogs.\n","before The day before Thanksgiving I read a Facebook post by a former teacher of mine. He had apparently ordered a cake from Archie's for the holiday. Well, he posted a photo of the cake and seeing it motivated me to check the bakery's website--they were open for another half hour on that fateful day. \n","\n","I did what any red-blooded American woman with a sweet tooth and a car would at that point: I gunned it to Archie's. I made it just in time, and to my delight, they had three items left: two lemon\\/coconut cakes and a sweet potato pie. I couldn't decide which to get for the Thanksgiving dinner I was attending the following day. Archie's kind wife said I could buy one and she'd give me another to take with me. And so I did. \n","\n","The sweet potato pie was excellent, as was the coconut\\/lemon cake. Thank you to Archie and his lovely wife for the sweet desserts!\n","before What can I say about Fountain? Well, I suppose I cannot say much (good) about their service, though maybe I hit it on a bad night. Let me be more specific: I hit it on a Happy Hour Meetup Group night. I went as part of the group that recent evening, and though what I ate was decent--and for a crepe with bananas, chocolate and whipped cream, really, how could it have been anything less than that? Indeed I would probably rate it as slightly better than decent. What I would rate as less than that however, was the snide commentary I received from a man who presumably was part of the restaurant staff. I had sat at a table with friends that happened to be near a couch. If one sat in one of the four chairs at the table just so, that chair would block off a pathway where one might pass through in getting from the door to the bar and rest of the restaurant. There were, of course, other pathways to get from point A (the door) to point B (the bar\\/rest of the restaurant). However I was the unlucky one that particular evening to have the audacity (apparently) to sit in the chair that if tilted a certain way, blocked one path to getting to the bar. I had no idea that I was blocking anything that night, however--I'd never been to the restaurant before. In any case, a man wearing a grey sweater, if memory serves me right, came up to me and scolded me in a sarcastic tone for sitting where I was and in a snobby manner, suggested I get thee up and movin' from the space my behind currently occupied. Will I be back to Fountain anytime in the next decade? If you were me, what would you do? ....That's what I thought.\n","before I love the lobster corn chowder. It was delicious beyond measure. Some lobster soups (which are usually bisques) tend to be too thick and creamy. This soup was not thick, but had just the right amount of body; it was the perfect texture. The corn and lobster bits balanced nicely with what I thought might be whole milk, as opposed to full-throttle cream. You get what you pay for in spades at Lemon Falls--with a price tag of $8+ (dine in), one might do a double take. But it was, without a doubt, worth every penny.\n","before The vibe here is cool all the way around. I enjoyed relaxing on a comfy bed-like cushion here along the river last night, and witnessing the chic style of the ladies behind the bar. I admired their ensembles. I was a little upset to find that, like at many bars today, cocktails and coffee drinks were not on the menu. But the atmosphere was awesome, grown-up and professional. And the pool looks like it would be a blast during the day! I would have loved to have stayed for the dancing, but the crowd was a bit large for my ears that night.\n","before I tried their brownies and chocolate chip cookies today at the Cleveland Flea. Both items were delicious, so much so that I bought one of each after sampling. These items DO NOT TASTE vegan. They are rich and complex in flavor and texture. I am excited to go to their store in Lakewood next month when they open.\n","before I dropped by the other day because I was in the area. After seeing the \"pizza by the slice\" sign, I figured I'd try two slices and see how it was, since it had been at least three years since last having their pizza, and I wasn't starving. \n","\n","I ordered one topping, which was garlic. I *love* garlic. I guess I expected regular-defined as \"normal,\"sized pizza slices. But I was pleasantly surprised when I got a regular-sized pizza box and saw that the TWO slices took up practically THE ENTIRE BOX. These slices were that large. I was very pleased! The New York style pizza is wonderful and I will be back .\n","before This place is freakin' amazing. Consider that you are in Cleveland, Ohio--then close your eyes and imagine that you have been transported to a hip, clean, gorgeous beach somewhere off the coast of Highway 1 in California. \n","\n","This is a restaurant you would encounter on that stretch of highway. This is worth paying for. \n","\n","I love the sandwich they have here and get it whenever I can. It features toasted coconut, avocado and other delicious vegan toppings served on lovely fresh toasted bread. The cashew mylk with lavender is my favorite drink so far. I went in today looking for carrot juice. They had a delicious offering of carrot\\/beet\\/pineapple\\/ginger\\/red pepper cold-press raw juice. It was awesome. It was not cheap. It was totally worth it.\n","before Glad to have gone here to fix my glasses recently. There is another Lenscrafters that I thought was not doing the best job with customer service and communication. But this one is closer to where I live and the help I received today was great. A very kind and patient employee there fixed my glasses. I was happy.\n","before This rating is based on food quality and staff encounters. I had an overpriced shrimp and linguini dish that was okay, but nothing to write home about. The sauce was simply bland--no bite, no spice. The server was nice enough. But later in the evening, I noticed another server being kind of short with a guest. It was an unapologetic type of act in response to a complaint. In short, I won't be back. Though the entertainment was good--a live band, and the group I went with along with the crowd at the restaurant, \n","was wonderful.\n","before Not impressed. As another Yelper said, she found herself anticipating the opening of this place, only to find that upon going, the experience was not what she'd anticipated. I had a paneer sandwich--which is Indian cheese, vegetables and sauce rolled up in naan. I agree with the Yelper who said this place is like an Indian version of Piada. The prices are steep for what you get, in my opinion. The size of my sandwich was normal--it wasn't like I was \"stuffed\" after eating it. The mango lassi was expensive -- $3.45 or $3.95, and was just okay. It was missing a key ingredient: rosewater--an essential component in a quality lassi. Anyhow--I think my bill was just below $12 for dine-in. \n","\n","The people were kind and friendly though, and I thought it was cool that you could see the naan being cooked through the glass wall. Food is expensive these days, unfortunately. Maybe with a few tweaks, this place will improve over time.\n","before That'll teach me to order lobster bisque at a sub place. \n","\n","I was in town this past weekend for a variety of engagements, and wanted to get the superb lobster corn chowder at Lemon Falls. Unfortunately I arrived in town late--a few minutes after 6pm. Lemon Falls closed at 6pm on Saturday. So sucks to be me, but to get some food prior to attending a Norwex party was my objective, so onward soldiering for the chow went me. And cheap. I should add that I was seeking inexpensive food that fateful night. Well, cheap for Chagrin Falls anyway. So to Dave's Subs I went. I usually get the Haight-Ashbury. But something caught my attention Saturday night--a \"lobster bisque\" advert on the back board. My goodness--lobster bisque at a sub place? Sacre bleu! I figured I'd ask for a slurp to verify its decency before investing. Alas though, I was told no samples. I asked where the bisque was procured. Sorry we can't tell you. All we can say is someone makes it for us. Hmmm. Who could this elusive someone be? \n","\n","It was past six and I wanted to eat and run, so I figured, heck Michelle, let's give it a shot. \n","\n","I wasn't impressed. The bisque was okay certainly. But also certainly nothing to write home about. Won't make this mistake again. Next time I'm at Dave's, it's back to one of the classics that this place does so well.\n","before This place sold me two pairs of glasses. That's fine. But I needed to return one of the two of them because I needed a more specified type of glasses than the optometrist here prescribed for me. I returned one pair. I needed to change the prescription on the other pair. The customer service here is poor. The individuals I dealt with on the phone did not know how to treat customers--to provide an example: I was told to call back in a half hour when someone who would know how to answer my question would be there. In other words, the right foot has no clue about what the left foot is doing. Nor does it care. The doctor's portion of the office seems to have nothing to do with the glasses' fitting portion of the office. They have nothing to do with them--and want nothing to do with them, and vice-versa. \n","\n","There is an obvious lack of communication acumen here. I will never go here again for glasses.\n","before The only reason I give the bus station in Cleveland two stars instead of one is because of Kevin the Security Guard. I arrived at the station around 3:15am, because I missed the Megabus I was scheduled on by 9 minutes in New York. If you want to hear a long, gory tirade with shocking details, I can pm you. For the purposes of this review, however, I'll just touch on a few facts.\n","\n","One fact is that the customer service skills are severely lacking at the Chester Avenue location. Martin Luther King Jr. once said something to the effect of this: \"The greatest sin a man can commit against his fellow man is not to hate him, but to be indifferent to him--that is the essence of inhumanity.\" The quote is not verbatim, but you get the idea. The feeling one is left with after encountering staff at the Greyhound Bus Lines terminal is that of being treated with indifference. *Save for Kevin the Security Guard, whose attention to my questions and assistance in helping me get on the right bus at the right time were a G-dsend. Thank you Kevin. \n","\n","Another fact is that the station in Cleveland, while historic, also could benefit from a better air ventilation system\\/exhaust fan near the restaurant area because of the fried food smell pervading the air. In addition, the station would be more welcoming to passengers if it had more comfortable seats. Without a blanket underneath your rear here, you will not be likely to tolerate sitting for more than a few minutes. At least I was not able to. \n","\n","I ran into a few friendly characters outside the building, and chatted about Kyrie, LeBron and Kevin Love for a bit with one of them. We agree next year is gonna be the big one.\n","before I went here for lunch today after reading about it on yelp. The tandoori shrimp I ordered came with about 5 or 6 *huge* (I MEAN HUGE) shrimp cooked to a perfect hue of red, served on a bed of rice, along with grilled onions and red peppers ($14.95). I had the sweet lassi to drink ($2.99), which was excellent. To expound on the lassi--I learned that it was not made with rosewater, as I had previously assumed these types of drinks were, but rather with cardamom. To further expound, some lassis are indeed made with rosewater (as I discovered later online), but at Kabob Place, they happen to be made with cardamom instead. I chose not to get the lunch buffet (8.95 weekdays) because I'm not crazy about lentils and a few of the other offerings included in that deal. They also have a bunch of other to-go lunch deals ranging in price from $2 for 2 samosas to $7.99 for a chicken kabob.\n","before I had the opportunity to watch the owner make macarons and it was fascinating to me as I had never realized or thought of those delicious treats as being made right there at the store--but indeed they are. Ground almonds and egg whites (and possibly sugar) are the only ingredients that go into the macarons, save for whatever filling is going into the particular flavor being made at that time.\n","before It was a place I'd been wanting to try since moving to Lakewood a year and a half ago. Last night, my waiting ended as I and a friend dined at Players. I happened to have a $10 off coupon from \"The Deck\" for Cleveland Independents restaurants, and I used it at Players. All in all, I think it was a smart choice. The salad I had included Gorgonzola, which I enjoy normally. I asked the waiter whether he recommended the salad featuring that cheese--a more traditional take on fancy salad, or the one with pears and a vinaigrette. He simply asked if I liked Gorgonzola. I responded \"yes,\" and that was that--it was the salad that included that that I ordered. The salad was pleasant enough--nothing to write home about, but good. I ordered a pizza because I'd heard Players had good ones. I probably should not have for the price. I noticed they tack on an additional buck plus some change to each additional item added to the pizza--'nothing usual about that'  you might say. But when considering the size and quality of the dish, it turned out to be, like the salad, nothing to write home about. My friend made a wiser choice, though a more expensive one, in going with the crab cakes. He let me try a little and I discovered the flavor was more \"worth the price\" than my pizza. It was around $24 for his crab cakes. They were delicious, and I was particularly impressed with the asparagus that came on the same plate: it was cooked just right--not overdone and soggy, not underdone and too hard. Just right. I noted that his dish also included risotto under the crab cakes, which looked good. An overpriced adventure, minus the $10 off coupon we used. I do not plan on returning soon. But I give it a simple \"good\" rating.\n","before I went last night and had the Painkiller Level 1. It was fantabulous. It is a combination of pineapple, coconut and rum. And some spices added on top. It was to die for delicious. So I'll be returning to this place. The bartender Sean (or Shawn) (sp?) was a good communicator and told me the tale of his coming to Porco. General Manager Shannon provided more commentary. This place is well-run and the atmosphere is uniquely Tiki.\n","before Oh yum. So yummy. Scene: Monday night happy hour at the bar with my friend Steve, who recently celebrated a birthday. \n","\n","I had the salmon burger--it was cooked just right (medium rare) and came with asparagus and red tomato slices, and had a spiced mayo-esque sauce on it. A helping of what seemed to be homemade potato chips rode shotgun--tasty when dipped in the tangy tamarind sauce that came with Steve's fried calamari. He also ordered the (New England) clam chowder. I asked for a slurp and Steve obliged. After slurping, I silently resolved to get a bowl the next time I'm at this establishment--it was perfect. Not too thick. My father would have flipped his wig. And he preferred Manhattan clam chowder. \n","\n","We shared a mocha cake for dessert that came with dollop of berry sorbet and a good-sized shaving of chocolate on top.  \n","\n","Curtis, the gracious bartender, not only offered a recommendation on desserts for the occasion, but also brought us out a dish of three or four chocolate-covered strawberries after I mentioned it was Steve's birthday. I'll say it again: Curtis--you are a gentleman and a scholar.\n","before Okay fine, I'm addicted. Chalk another one up for the books. My first review perhaps was not fully thought out or the sticker shock might have rubbed me the wrong way. But mark my words, these bagels are worth $1.50 each (sans cream cheese schmear). I buy 6 and eat one on the way home. I slice the others in half and freeze 'em. I take one bagel out each morning and toast it, schmear it with butter, and voila!\n","before I went here today for lunch and got the spicy tuna roll to go. It was excellent. The flavor was not fishy or overwhelming--it had just the right amount of kick. Also--you get a good amount of food--there is no skimping here--which made it well worth $7.99. The roll is made to order right in front of you--if you want to add additional toppings, you can. The toppings looked very fresh and they put your roll in a cool white cardboard \"roll in\\/roll out\" box. They also have a happy hour at this place that they told me about, and asked if I wanted a shopper's type card. I did. This is a nice place. The staff answered questions I had about toppings and how to prepare seaweed sheets I have at home. Very helpful. I will be back.\n","before I'm going all in on this one. And it is due to more than just amazing food. Our server was a professional--that was clear from the start. We ordered a date milkshake to split and the lovely young lady brought us our milkshake to share divided between two cute glass drinking cups, each with its own spoon and straw. Now that is what you call service. I was very pleased. I was even more delighted after I tasted the concoction, which easily rates 5 stars in my book. Rich vanilla ice cream with bits of dates throughout, giving the shake a little taste of heaven in every sip. Yum. \n","\n","I ordered the Louisiana Shrimp Burger. This was my second visit to Flipside, but I had not been there in over a year, I would say. The burger was divine. Succulent shrimp in a thick patty form, with pickles, a tomato, and lettuce. The only things that were less than great I avoided. These were 1)a fried green tomato that looked to be overly greasy. Because my stomach reacts unwell to greasy fare, I de-fried it by removing the breaded and fried part of the green tomato. The other qualm was a creamy sauce on the side that came with the shrimp burger. I do not like cream sauces and so I passed on that puppy. \n","\n","Otherwise this place rocks. Will return.\n","before Unimpressed.\n","\n","I had been wanting to try this place because I am a fan of Mike Trivisonno's radio show on WTAM 1100. I learned from our server that the place is owned by Mike's son, who is also named Mike. \n","\n","I had the French onion soup and a crab cake sandwich. The soup was good. The atmosphere of a restaurant influences how the food tastes. I'll elaborate: the soup was good, but not as good as French onion I've had at another place recently--the other place had a warmer, cozy environment. Triv's by contrast, had a cold, dull, almost generic feeling. The bowl the soup was in was not visibly affected by the cheese in the soup to the extent that the cheese stuck to it (which would indicate that the soup was not, say, microwaved to cook the cheese over the top of the bowl). I mention this because in a better bowl of French onion soup, the cheese should be and would be charred to the bowl, indicating that it was baked in an oven, as opposed to microwaved. I realize I'm being nit-picky. But it's important. \n","\n","On to the crab cake sandwich: it was a grade below so-so. \n","\n","A note about my friend's meal: she ordered the \"special of the day.\" Unfortunately she reported to me and our server that she could not detect too much that was special about the meal. It was fish--I think walleye, with pasta. The fish was reportedly very plain and the pasta was average--with some parmesan and maybe butter or olive oil. In other words, her meal was almost the *opposite* of special.\n","before I saw the other two reviews and thought--this cannot be correct--better put in a true account of this festival. \n","\n","This is the truth: this is the best festival in Cleveland. A diverse array of cuisine representing the diversity of the continent of Asia. A world-class entertainer or entertainers have been brought in in the past few years. A child-friendly environment, one where you will feel comfortable bringing Junior and will be able to take him on a fun trolley ride through Asiatown. Free parking. Yes--you read that right--free parking. Last year the highlight for me was meeting Cleveland Mayor Frank Jackson, I must admit. But a close second to that would probably include drinking a refreshing coconut water--right out of the coconut.\n","before This place is wonderful. Marguerite (I might not be spelling that correctly) helped me today. She was amazing--her knowledge and customer service skills are second to none. She saved me and my car from a blowout by recognizing that I needed oil in the vehicle. This woman knows her business well. I'd go to this BP again any day and recommend Marguerite and her fellow associates. They are great.\n","before When I think of Heinen's of Bainbridge, I can't help but musing \"What more could one ask of a supermarket experience?\" The answer is simple: nothing. A warm, caring staff who over the years I have come to think of more as friends than sales associates. A few names come to mind, and in the interest of sharing my appreciation for them, I will name them: Michelle is great at the service desk. Rita has answered the phone on several occasions when I called to ask about food storage or preparation. Frank is in produce. Anita in the cheese section. All of these wonderful people, along with their colleagues, make my shopping experience there as enjoyable as a walk through the park on a sunny day, ice cream cone in hand.\n","before This is authentic Thai food that is fresh and piquant. I had the tom yum gum soup and it was excellent--nice and spicy, featuring shrimp, mushrooms and cilantro. Also worth every bite was the superior summer rolls--shrimp, rice noodles, carrots and another thing wrapped in rice paper rolls. Yum. I'm happy.\n","before Back today to get my fix: banana chocolate muffin and peanut butter\\/hot chocolate\\/alcohol concoction. I also got a carrot\\/orange juice in a bottle. The best thing today though: the awesome man behind the counter wrote down the recipe for a tumeric\\/almond milk drink for me so that I could put the recent canister of tumeric I purchased to use! I made it when I got home and it is AWESOME. Thank you!\n","before This is a very late review, and is written only because I know a couple people who have either 1)spoken well about this place and in fact eat there regularly, or 2)asked my opinion about Dianna's breakfast compared to another, worlds apart in terms of quality, restaurant. \n","\n","I've lived in Lakewood for over 2 years now, and in that time, have driven by Dianna's almost daily. I was first notified about the quality of food at this place by the restaurant itself, who had a large banner in front of their place notifying customers that Dianna's now had (this is not a direct quote) \"new lower food prices for the same quality food!\"\n","If that is not an endorsement, I don't know what is. \n","\n","My one friend who lives near me, frankly has unsophisticated taste. I'm not trying to be mean. That is just a hard fact. I don't attribute this to anything other than maybe a lack of traveling (aka worldliness). But I love my friend--he's a great man and a smart one at that. Maybe it's just naiveté, because he seems to love Dianna's. \n","\n","The other friend and I went to Dianna's one time I think the weekend after we dined at Grumpy's for Sunday brunch. I don't know why I agreed to go to Dianna's that day because I already had suspicions about the food there. On that day, prior to dining at Dianna's I had not ever experienced their food. Only heard about it and read that sign in front of the building. I guess I was a little bit tired that day, and in a fit of fatigue, agreed to try it with friend #2. My suspicions were confirmed that morning. This place is bad. DO NOT GO HERE. The quality of the food is significantly less than sub-par. Mushy hash browns, bland coffee.\n","before I went to Green Tara Yoga tonight after having lower back pain that has persisted over the course of many months. I have been to other yoga places, most recently the place on W. 25th St. in Ohio City. Green Tara Yoga is the best experience I have had by far.  \n","\n","If you are a teenager or a cheerleader, or want to listen to calming nature sounds and smell incense, you should not come here. But if you honestly want and need to feel better--if you have body aches and want a place that takes these issues seriously, Green Tara is your place. \n","\n","Karen took me and my issues seriously and she knew what she was doing. This woman is an expert. I thought I'd try it for one night, and ended up signing up for eight classes this evening. I am pleased.\n","before Please bring back The Mad Greek at Beachwood Place. I loved your chicken gyros there. For the life of me, I cannot understand why the food was so wonderful there, but is not so great, in my opinion, at the Cleveland Heights restaurant location. Best of luck. I will visit if the mall location returns in the future.\n","before I love Chick-Fil-A. Just wanted to get that out there. I love their grilled chicken sandwich, which is what I always order. Their lemonade is also good. I used to get the little chicken nuggets and have always liked them as well. So to review, Chick-Fil-A is awesome. Their staff is always very kind and provide superior customer service. I am a major fan.\n","before This is a supreme experience--one that any grocery shopper worth her salt should have. Heinen's of Rocky River is a gem. \n","\n","I love going grocery shopping--it is my joy, it is my passion. It is my luck that I live near this Heinen's. It's the only grocery store I shop at on the Westside. The people who work here are knowledgeable about their products and are always willing to answer questions. I call the store ahead of time to confirm that certain items (Yasso Greek Yogurt Bars--coconut flavor) are available and they are always kind and gracious. I've even ordered something from their Bainbridge store (wine produced in Chagrin Falls) and they transferred it over to the Rocky River location so I could pick it up. Such customer service practices are rare--but they are routine at Heinen's.\n","before I love this place--not only because it has good art and good coffee and foodstuffs, but also because it's across from the PD.\n","before This place is absolutely delicious! The food is authentic and the service is fantastic! I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a pleasant dining experience! Will be returning soon!\n","before I left this place with hair on both my legs upper and lower. I ended up spending three and half hours there and once I realized how much hair I still had I was pretty upset but didn't have the time to stay and have her fix it. There was scrapes on my legs from where she tried to get the remaining wax off with tweezers. Super young and very unprofessional. I would never go back, not even to have her fix the crappy job she did.\n","before My dog \"Gibson\" is in the Palm Glen Animal Hospital as I write this review. I've been dealing with Dr. Mangone and the Palm Glen staff for a couple of years now. Even though I'm not sure what Gibson's outcome is going to be, I am comfortable and confident that he's receiving the best care and comfort on this planet. These people are saints and I would never think of taking my pets anywhere else.\n","\n","Michael Anderson\n","before Our server Tim was amazing! Great drink reviews and was super fast and friendly. Would go to this place again for the great service and location. We were able to sit outside on a patio bar right on the strip.\n","before Absolutely disgusting customer service. I returned my car 23 Oct after renting for a couple of days and was told mt $500 deposit would be returned to me in 5 - 10 days. I phoned on 15 Nov to say I still did not have my deposit returned to me and Anita who was exceptionally rude said I must call my bank to sort it out. I said I had already called and they had said the funds had not been released. Every time I tried to talk she talked over me and then she eventually just put me on hold. I held on for 10 minutes because I knew she was hoping that I would just put down the phone. When she answered again I could hear that she was surprised that I was still there. I then said that I was in the middle of talking to her when she put me on hold and she said \"I got busy\". She then told me to phone my bank and put the phone down on me. DO NOT RENT FROM THIS COMPANY - absolutely horrendous experience and still don't have my $500 back.\n","before This is a great , intimate, and special gem of a place with fantastic creations from the James Beard award winning chef, Nobuo, in the Heritage Square's Teeter house, a historical old house with hardard floors and simple understated elegance, all in the heart of DT PHX. \n","\n","In what could be described as Izakaya Fusion small plates, or what one might call \"Japa Tapas\",  made with attention to detail, flavor and texture, at reasonable prices, this place was part of Phoenix  Yelp's Eats Week recently, with rave reviews from Yelp Foodies.\n","\n","In a cozy, quiet room with only 4 tables, with dark hardwood floors and minimal decorations, the two of us split the following:\n","\n","Small Bites\n","Kimchi ($6) - napa cabbage, dried shrimp, seasme oil, red chili. \n","Instead of the Korean staple fermented and limp, this was fresh cabbage with a lively flavor, crisp and crunchy, as a salad rather than a pickled side dish.

Relaxed atmoshere, not hoity toity at all, not attitudes, very down to earth. \n","\n","This is an excellent choice! And of my many reviews, only 10% or less get 5 stars from Wanugee, so you can trust my viewpoint and bell curve!\n","before This little muni type airport is very clean, fairly new or updated, only has a few gates, and has easy in and out access. It is about 10 miles from downtown Madison. The rental cars are just a walk away, and you need to check the counter to get your key, after which you can just drive off out of the lot. Because it is a smaller airport, there isn;t a lot of larger equipment servicing it. So if you are flying in from major distant airports, there is a good chance you will need to fly through ORD (via United) or MSP (Northwest) to get here. That also means you may be flying in a Bombardier Canada Air Jet puddle hopper.\n","before The Hotel Dauphine is on the South shore, across the river from downtown and old town Montreal. But it is next to a Metro station so traveling back and forth is easy to do, and you pay less on this side of the St. Lawrence. \n","\n","It is just over the Pont Jacques-Cartier, so driving back and forth is pretty easy, and parking is free, with plenty of it. You can get a nice, clean room, with faux hardwood linoleum floors for about $100 most of the time, and that includes a continental breakfast, too. You also get free WiFi in your room, and actually there is a desktop computer and monitor on the desk, so if you forgot your computer, Voila! \n","\n","There is of course a TV, iron, iron board, coffee maker. etc that you would find in most business type hotels. Since it is near education centers, a lot of students stay here and work here, but they are friendly and pretty well trained.  \n","\n","So if you want to save a little money and just be a couple of Metro stops from downtown Montreal, this is a good choice. Caution: the beds here are super firm!\n","before Most people who like Vietnamese Pho noodles (sometimes referred to as Tonkinese in Montreal) like the Pho Bo noodles, which is Beef (Bo) noodles. \n","\n","By far the beef is the most popular, and has a lot of variations. But if you like Chicken noodle soup (who doesn't, especially with a cold?) then Pho Tay Ho is known in Montreal for the best Pho Ga (chicken). \n","\n","They don't use free range chicken like Pho Ga An Nam in San Jose, CA, but they make a good Pho Ga.\n","before Comme Par Hasard (literally \"for as random,\" or \"by chance\") is a cute old home in old downtown Longueuil converted into this very nice and cozy Bistro. It feels like you were invited to a friend's or Grandma's house for dinner, with old traditional chairs and decor, soft lighting, and really friendly service. \n","\n","They have a good local biere (beer) menu that has strong beers (7.75% to 9% alcohol) as well as beers on tap and foreign bottles. There is a daily changing chalkboard of specials and favorites.\n","\n","The three of us all opted for the same daily special, an Okoberfest special with weiners, sauerkraut, with side spoons of dijon mustard, served with pomme frites and 2 small glasses of beer (biere blanc et rouge). The special ($21.95) included  soup or salad. The soup was a deicious pumpkin cream, and the salad included pumpkin, cheeese, greens and beets. \n","\n","Dessert was a large mix of chocolate pudding and chocolate mouse, but they had many other choices, like pumpkin creme brulee.\n","\n","Prices were not astronomical and service was very friendly and welcoming. I would recommend this place for friends, romance or business.\n","before Pho Lien is the best Vietnamese Beef Noodle (Pho Bo) restaurant in Montreal. Don't take my word for it, that is from the Vietnamese locals who know food. \n","\n","The owner used to run a factory locally, but when those opportunities went to China for cheaper costs, he had to shut down the Factory and try something different. So he went and hired the best Pho cook he could find, employed him for a year, and learned how to make good Pho. \n","\n","It isn't to California standards, but here in Montreal, C'est Magnifique!\n","before Came here again for a business dinner. We ordered the \"Daughter\" all in one menu (#3), which is Beef, Chicken and Pork, all marinated. \n","It came with romaine salad first, and then a bunch of banchan dishes on the side.

She had great timing, handling other tables, but coming back right on time to do all of our cooking for us, from starting a meat, to turning it over, to serving it to us. \n","\n","We had a nice table against the back wall, so we could talk business without a lot of noise, and with Eunice's professional timing, not any interuptions, either. \n","\n","We had plenty of food for 3 grown men, and with the Soju, the total was $105 before tip.\n","before Noodle Asia is inside the Venetian Hotel, in the corner of the Casino near the Sports Book. \n","\n","It should be called Noodle China. 95% of the dishes are some variety of Chinese food, be it Shanghainese, Taiwanese, Cantonese. \n","\n","Sure, they throw in a couple of Japanese things, like Edamame appetizer, and something that is wok fried udon? (More typically, this would be yakisoba, or fried soba noodles). And they do have at least 1 Korean dish, Kimchee! I didn't see any Viet noodles, Thai noodles, Korean noodles, Singaporean noodles, or more Japanese noodles, etc. \n","\n","The atmosphere is casual, with an open view of the large woks in the kitchen, with the water flowing over the cooking area to remove all the grease and tidbits spilled in the stir-fry cooking process, just like a Chinatown kitchen. \n","\n","The food isn't bad actually. The green veggie of the day was a choice of Gai Lan (Chinese Broccoli) or Baby Bok Choy. I went for the Bok Choy. NIce small baby stems. \n","\n","I also ordered a bowl of Nau Nam Mein Curry Soup, or Brisket of Beef Curry Noodle Soup, It hit the spot and warmed me up, as I was chilled by the overactive air-conditioning in the Venetian. I don't know how those cocktail waitresses in the skimpy, short , sleeveless, bar wench dresses can stand the chill. Their dual weather barometers definitely would perk up in the nippyness.  Mine did!\n","\n","I also ordered an oolong tea, which came in a cast iron Japanese style tea pot. \n","\n","The service is just a little friendlier than a Chinatown diner. But they are strict about waiting to be seated! IF you seat yourself, they may call you out on it! There is a bar you can eat at and watch the cooks, or plenty of tables where you can watch the gamblers and those freezing waitresses. \n","\n","So Oolong tea, baby bok choy, and Brisket of Beef Curry Noodle soup. Sounds like about $10 in your typical Chinatown, right?\n","\n","This is Vegas baby, try and guess again. Go higher, way higher! \n","\n","How about $30!?\n","For one person?!? WTF! \n","\n","If you are a cheap Chinese person raised in Chinatown or FOB, or if you are less than fourth generation ABC, don't go here! You will feel ripped off!  This is not Hon's Won Ton on Kearney in SF for sure! \n","\n","Tea: $3.50\n","Stir Fried Bok Choy: $12.00\n","Curry Beef Noodle Soup: $12.95\n","Tax: $2.30\n","Total $30.75!\n","\n","You are better off driving down Spring Mountain just outside of the Venetian, due west to about Valley View, and go to Las Vegas' Chinatown. (Actually, unlike Noodle Asia, you can get Viet, Korean, Thai, and most of the other noodles of Asia from there.)\n","before Visiting Las Vegas and need a Pho Fix? \n","Tired of paying through the nose for flashy Casino Faux Asian food without authentic, down-home goodness? \n","\n","If you have a rental, venture up the strip and turn west on Spring Mountain (Circus Circus and Sahara, near Fashion Show Mall). Go about 2 blocks, and between Wynn Road and Decatur, you will find the asian shopping and restaurant district of LV. Vietnamese, Japanese, Korean, Malaysian, Taiwanese, you name it.!\n","\n","Pho Saigon 8 is in this area. A large place seating up to 100 (25 tables of four). It must be run by the second generation, because it is clean, has quality decorative modern furniture, high ceilings, clean floors, computer POS terminals, and tasteful 18x24 art pieces of young Vietnamese women. Popular love songs, but no big screen DVD variety shows!\n","\n","Their name implies they only serve Pho, but they serve a large array of typical Vietnamese dishes. Yes, Pho Bo (beef) and Pho Ga (chicken) ranging from $4.50 to $7.00; but also Hu Tieu and Mi (Pork or Seafood Soups with Rice or Egg Noodles $7.50),  Com Dia (Rice Plates $6.95 to $9.00), Bun (Vermicelli noodles including the popular  Bun Bo Hue, from $6.35 to $9.50) and deserts (3 types of Che) and drinks (i.e. Vietnamese coffee, coconut juice, plum soda, etc.)\n","\n","The Pho was good, albeit the sprouts and basil were a little wilted. This is a pleasant atmosphere with pretty good food and acceptable service. Not sure what the 8 represents in Vietnamese. It might imply that the restaurant is run by Chinese, since 8 in that culture is good luck, and also refers to longevity, as in the popular myths of the 8 immortals.\n","before The Saint Laurent street corridor has a host of restaurants of all types, particularly clustered around the Complexe Ex-Centris shopping mall. \n","\n","Most of the restaurants have a polished feel, nearly all with candle lights on every table in a darkened setting, in contemporary designs and decent service. \n","\n","Buona Notte (Good Evening\\/Night in Italian) is right in the thick of this, across the street from the Complexe. It has a variety of Italian dishes, with antipasta dishes priced in the teens (CAD) and various pastas priced in the 20's. \n","\n","There are about 5 or 10 Italian restaurants in this section of town within a couple of blocks, and this one is moderately priced, contemporary but casually decorated, and a decent choice.\n","\n","From their website:\n","\n","For the past 16 years Buonanotte has been setting trends in Montreal's culinary scene. The Buonanotte Family is continuously looking for ways to captivate its' clientele while maintaining it's roots by staying true to what matters the most which is \"Traditional Italian Cooking\", it is for this reason, that The Buonanotte Family would like to cordially invite you to discover a dining experience like no other.\n","\n","Every Thursday night, Buonanotte will be transformed into a culinary paradise featuring a warm, alluring \"Traditional Italian\" touch (just like an Italian grandma's cooking), where you will be treated with the finest home cooking delights Italian cuisine has to offer, as every month throughout the year, the Giovedi Si Mangia menu will feature culinary forte of a specific Italian region for you to discover!\n","\n","The evening begins with a 5 à 8, where you can enjoy a relaxing lounge atmosphere with your friends and colleagues, while the DJ on hand serves up the tracks that will alleviate your spirits and lead you into the night. For the supper, you will be able to choose from a $50 fixed menu, four course hearty feast or create your own from our selection of fish,\n","meats, homemade fresh pasta, risotto and antipasti as well succulent dessert creations from our pastry chef and much more.\n","\n","And while your palate savors all these authentic Italian flavors, enjoy our \"Gazzetta di Buonanotte\", a time-honore Italian tradition that will feature a new region with its local delights for you to take pleasure in every month.\n","before This is a great show for the entire family. \n","\n","The costumes are spectacular, the set design simple but imaginative, the performances were all strong, the singing was a joy, and the music is Oscar winning. What's not to like? The theatre is one large bowl, without balcony, and there really are very few poor seats in the house. Acoustics were superb. \n","\n","About 16 years ago I watched the VHS tape of this movie about 100 times when my favorite relative was a toddler. Consequently, I know the story, the music, just about every line. The show plays very true to that movie, with a few minor adjustments, but otherwise, you will recognize each scene if you've seen the movie. They even cast the performers with voices very close to the original sound. Maybe not quite James Earl Jones as Mufasa and Whoopie Goldberg as the lead Hyena, but pretty close. Scar sounds like Jeremy Irons, Kimba and Nala sound similar, even the Toucan Zazu has the same British accent as the Disney movie, and you'd swear the Warthog Pumbaa was Ernie Sabella and the Meer Cat Timone was Nathan Lane \n","\n","I loved the rich African singing, colors, and drum beats. The chorus was full of African performers, supplementing the mostly American lead performers with a rich undertone of African harmonies in the larger numbers, with great Swahili chorals.  \n","\n","This opened on Broadway back in 1997 and won 6 Tony Awards, and has been here in Vegas at least 5 years. As I recall, songwriters Elton John and Tim Rice won an academy award for their music as well. \n","\n","After you've ooohed and aaawed over the 7 or so Quebecois acrobatic shows on the Strip, this is a nice and fun change of pace.\n","before Went for dinner last night, food was awesome, especially the onion tart we got for starters.  Drinks were good too, but I got a cranberry lemonade with vodka and it was kind of weak.   For my entree I had the Mediterranean salad and split a mushroom pizza, both of which were very good.\n","\n","The only negative was the length of time to get our food.
